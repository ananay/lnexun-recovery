Although I didn’t attend it on the second day but I know u guys would have worked as hard as u did on the first day.<br>So coming back to the topic, this topic which I am going to talk about will allow u to send anonymous e-mails. Well for years we have been receiving spam e-mails on our e-mail inbox but have never wondered how is it possible to create e-mails in which the source is not given and the subject has names such as “agaggasdahsdhfd”. Well I’m going to answer them today.<br>The p.c. has 2 types of ports- internal and external. Internal ports are the one’s which are used by the system to carry out transactions on the internet and one such port on the system is port 25 or smtp port. It is the port which is used to send mails from u’r system to another system whereas on a server it is used to carry out the process of sending and receiving mails. So here is u’r simple answer, ”just get into the server and write forged e-mails.” But I guess that would be illegal.<br>So we have found a totally legal way by which this can be done. Here is where the term “open mail relay servers” comes into play, these servers allow free public access and are not password protected. NOW if karan is reading this post then he should definitely concentrate on this part and the next one too…<br>I had got this idea of writing this post bec’z I have come across a whole new list of open mail relay servers, which is over here “ <a href="http://www.theorem.com/spam/openservers.htm" data-href="http://www.theorem.com/spam/openservers.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.theorem.com/spam/openservers.htm</a> ”<br>So how can u write an anonymous mail, well I’m going to explain that by using my favorite smtp server (and probably shocking to karan) “smtp-roam.stanford.edu”<br>1) open the run box and type the following “telnet smtp-roam.stanford.edu 25”<br>2) now something known as a banner saying “smtp Stanford” would appear(if u don’t get this then probably u’r using sify or some very bad internet connection)<br>3) Just to check whether everything is working type ”help”, to get a list of commands.<br>4) Now write “helo microsoft.com”(to pose yourself to be an employee of Microsoft, u can write anything u like)<br>5) Write “mail from:” this address can be a forged one too. Try anything u like and it will work<br>6) Write “rcpt to:”(write karanmisra to send it to karan or name of anyother person u know in Stanford).<br>7) Write “data” to write the message and when finished just put a full stop in the next line in order to stop and send the message.<br>So now u can send an anonymous message to karan. U can also use the list (http://www.theorem.com/spam/openservers.htm ) which has open relay servers to send the users of those servers a forged mail. My personal favorite in that list is “smtp.prioritycomputer.com” , it’s a company in noida.<br><br>Ankit</p></div></div></section>
