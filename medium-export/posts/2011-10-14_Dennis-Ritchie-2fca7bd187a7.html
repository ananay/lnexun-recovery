He died a month after his birthday, according to his biography on a webpage of Alcatel-Lucent’s Bell Labs. Ritchie joined Bell Labs in the late 1960s.</p><p name="f150" id="f150" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The company confirmed his death to The Associated Press but would not disclose the cause of death or when Ritchie died. A spokeswoman said the company was trying to contact his family.</p><p name="edb3" id="edb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ritchie is best known for his contributions to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/computer-programming" data-href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/computer-programming" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">c</a>omputer programming and software. The C programming language, which Ritchie developed in the early 1970’s, is still popular. It has gone through a number of upgrades, and it is commonly used for website development and other computer tasks. The Unix operating software also surged in popularity. It and its offshoots, including the open-source Linux, are widely used today, in corporate servers and even mobile phones.</p><p name="920b" id="920b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ritchie’s biography on the Bell Labs site says that he was born on September 9, 1941 in Bronxville, New York, and studied physics and math at Harvard University.</p><p name="f110" id="f110" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My undergraduate experience convinced me that I was not smart enough to be a physicist, and that computers were quite neat,” Ritchie wrote. “My graduate school experience convinced me that I was not smart enough to be an expert in the theory of algorithms and also that I liked procedural languages better than functional ones.”</p><p name="7066" id="7066" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Jeong Kim, president of Bell Labs, wrote in a blog post that Ritchie was “truly an inspiration to all of us, not just for his many accomplishments, but because of who he was as a friend, an inventor, and a humble and gracious man.”</p></div></div></section>
