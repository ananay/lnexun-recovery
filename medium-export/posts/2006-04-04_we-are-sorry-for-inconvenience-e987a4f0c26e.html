Exun stands for Experts Unlimited.<br>Exun is the Computer Club of DPS RK Puram.<br>But you guys already knew that. Also, this is not the point of my post<br><br>My point is that since we call ourselves members of a computer club, we should:<br>1. Be Blazing Fast with whatever we do and not sit on our jobs.<br>2. Be technologically sound!!<br>3. Google anything we dont know about.<br>4. If you cant find it on Google. Go to Wikipedia.<br>5. Have read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy<br>6. Know the answer to the question,”What happens when you search for Jawahar Singh on Google?”^^^^^^<br><br><br>Now coming to the real point of all points that I want to point out.<br>PLEASE CHECK YOUR EMAIL AND LNEXUN ATLEAST ONCE IN 2 DAYS.<br><br>Also, since we are members of a computer club, it is necessary that we all have email ids to say the least(next on the list, portable mp3 players.). And no, the hostellers arent excused.<br><br>And so, for those of you who do not have email ids, please make them, or ask for GMAIL invites.<br>And for those who do have email ids, please share them with us.<br><br>And for those whose email ids are nowhere to be found on the exunclan website, please tell us what they are.*<br><br>signing off<br>G<br><br>PS: Always keep a towel handy<br>PPS: You will have to read H2G2** to understand the PS and the title<br><br>* That was actually the main point of this post<br>** H2G2 — Hitchhikers Guide…..<br><br>^^^^^^- Jawahar Singh is a former exun member. The result was: Jawahar Singh is dead. Although you might not find this result anymore. This question has been asked in Exun Quizzes. Quizzers please take note.</p></div></div></section>
