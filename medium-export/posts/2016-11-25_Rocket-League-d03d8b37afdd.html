The possibilities of various moves that Psyonix has allowed, and the sandbox nature of the game, have really helped this game hit its stride. I mean, you can jump off the wall, fly towards the ball, dribble the ball on your head, use the balls for a 1–2–1, and even hit a pool shot using another person’s car!<br>On the dark side though, rubber-banding, lags and other hitches during online play are common, and since there are no servers in India, the high ping remains a constant thorn in the flesh. The AI is relatively stupid as well, scoring own goals regularly for no rhyme or reason, leaving you frustrated beyond compare.<br>The matchmaking balances the skill relatively well, with no awkward Rookie versus Expert matches taking place. Also, the possibility of creating Private Lobbies is a huge plus if you wanna go mano e mano with that one friend and show them who’s boss.</p><p name="2dff" id="2dff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With football and cars, does Psyonix have the right mix?</p><p name="4225" id="4225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Platform: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, Linux<br>Developed by: Psyonix<br>Release date: July 7, 2015</p><p name="81c8" id="81c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ball is in the air. The attacker lies in wait, and the goalie, ready to parry. As the ball falls towards the goal, the attacker hits, and scores, flying with his car to the top of the cage, celebrating…<br>Yes, you read that right. Car. That, dear reader, is the premise of Rocket League — football with cars. And mind you, these aren’t the 40 year old minivans your grandpa used to drive — they’re supersonic beasts, which can fly (and do a whole lotta other stuff as well.)<br>The game is the hyper — powered sequel to Psyonix’s original Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars or SARPBC for short. It builds on its predecessor, refining the Thunderdome like cage matches, heavily improving the visuals (have a look below):</p><figure name="66e4" id="66e4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Tvznnf1TpybcNGso.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="169" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sarpbc_3-300x169.jpg" alt="sarpbc_3" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Tvznnf1TpybcNGso.jpg"></figure><p name="cd0a" id="cd0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A typical SARPBC interface</p><figure name="e82a" id="e82a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*YguQ0al-jZo6s_Pg.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="169" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6f0df079f0ec8c47bdbbde38f7cdfaa1-300x169.jpg" alt="6f0df079f0ec8c47bdbbde38f7cdfaa1" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YguQ0al-jZo6s_Pg.jpg"></figure><p name="bcec" id="bcec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And… Rocket League. See the difference?<br>and adding various customization options (also an active player base — almost no one played SARPBC), and regular updates with new game modes like Ice — Hockey and Basketball (not kidding).<br>For the uninitiated, Rocket League pits two teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 players in a cage like arena — with one objective — score.

It leaves you with that unsatisfying greed to play ‘one more’, till you’re able to pwn Kronovi himself. The game is available on PC, PS4 and Xbox One for a mere 500 bucks. I strongly recommend you get this one.</p><p name="acdb" id="acdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Verdict: ESSENTIAL<br>Score: 9/10</p><p name="16d0" id="16d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Reviewed by: Ayush Singla</p></div></div></section>
