Needless to say was the contribution of All members who were present on both the days and also of all teachers and non-teaching staff<br><br>Thank You All<br><br>As for those who weren’t there, try and be there next time.<br><br>Although Exun was a success there were a few things missing.<br><br>The duties were a bit improperly decided in case of escorts<br><br>What we need to do from next time is assign some duties to the little ones after their escort job is done as escorting is just a morning affair<br><br>The ones who did a terrific job<br><br>Manas: i would say thats a great effort by someone in 9th to manage the whole gaming event. Hats off<br><br>All 12thies: They were all doing some kind of work so well theyre all great<br><br>All 11thies who were present did a great job with the registration and all<br><br>Dhruv and Suri with the web updates were truly efficient<br><br>Udit, this friend of mine never refused any work assigned to him<br><br>Akul: he is a sincere chap and never refuses work<br><br>Abhijit: this tall fellow is also quite a great person to be in exun especially when we have to put banners<br><br>Aayush, Vansh and the rest of the 9thy lot were also doing an exceptional job except for some whining here and there<br><br>The only 8thys i saw doing work were Saumya, Aviral and Diggi.<br><br>Rahul also did work but with too much of whining<br><br>Some incidents from exun<br><br>Nisheeth over the Walkie-Talkie says:” We need escorts, We need escorts, We need escorts, We need escorts, We need escorts, We need escorts,”<br><br>then he goes “ we have too many escorts, does anyone want any”<br><br>Basically for anything he needed, he repeated it till he got that thing so we had to switch off our walklie-talkies till then<br><br>Then we had Ankit W. who gave me the idea of making funny noises while anyone was saying anything so we had a fun time with that. I also started playing songs. We also heard “khaike Paan banaras wala”<br><br>Three cheers for Exun 2004 and 2005 here we come<br><br>G</p></div></div></section>
