It was interesting to talk to him and to get to know of how they create a ‘hypothetical’ person their client and then cater to his needs to create a universally accepted OS.<br><br><br><br>As we know, application softwares are designed for a particular person or organization. That is not the case with an OS. An OS needs to be more widely accepted among a larger base of customers which might have little or nothing in common vis-Ã -vis the solutions they require.</p><p name="68d2" id="68d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, Microsoft surveys people all over the world for their lifestyle patterns and the solutions they expect from Microsoft to make them realize their potential. Keeping the slogan of the company in mind, they survey different people which includes students, professionals, corporate-giants, home-users etc.</p><p name="bef5" id="bef5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Integrating the differentiated data that they collect, they make a â€˜hypotheticalâ€™ person that has all the major requirements and expectations of an OS and â€˜seeâ€™ that person as their client, thereby developing software that would be a universally accepted solution for requirements of all.</p><p name="3fdb" id="3fdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mr. Pradeep, who interviewed me, is in the team developing the OS after MS Windows Longhorn, presently codenamed as Longhorn+1.</p><p name="90f0" id="90f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My deepest thanks to Mukesh Sir for giving me a chance to interact with Mr. Pradeep and, although in a small way, for having a contribution from my side for the development of Longhorn+1 to be released in a few yearsâ€™ time.</p></div></div></section>
