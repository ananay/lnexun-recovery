Should we work on it after the website is made so that it goes according to the design and other placements or we should make it separately ? <br><br>2. The logo can be very simple — we can just use a unique font (like Gursartaj had shown us the exun logo with Captain podd font)<br><br>3. A small stylish graphics can go with the logo which will also look simple.<br><br>4. The present logo is also good. <br><br>As far as the Website is concerned -<br><br>1. In the beginning we shouldn’t go for any complex designs with rollovers , gradient effects and big animations. Lets start with a basic html homepage with a simple header and navigation menu.<br><br>2. Slowly all designers can contribute and we can comeout with ideas and accordingly we will alter the template.<br><br><br>3. The other thing which is very important is the matter of the website.We have to decide that what more content we have to add at the right pages besides the existing material on <a href="http://www.exunclan.com" data-href="http://www.exunclan.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.exunclan.com</a> <br><br>The task before us is not very easy but its also not difficult — our combind efforts will help.Almost all of us have given our contributions personally — be it the template or the logo or any flash animation.What is required now — is the joint effort. I have been noticing — we post our work here … others comment / give their views … then its finished and forgotten.Lets start finalizing things…I think on the basis of fields(like webdesigner , photoshop person , animator) we can assign the different parts of the website and start building it.Ofcourse .. Mukesh sir’s help is the must.<br><br>Here are some logo designs — analyze each one and give your views.</p></div></div></section>
