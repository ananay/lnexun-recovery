Luckily, the opinion of world has evolved, with technology now being thought of as a tool to help to earn a living, a platform to influence anyone, and a chance to revolutionise the world. An article in The Verge called today’s youth ‘The Startup Generation’. Why? Is it easy to succeed and become rich with a self-run business? Is it really true that everyone can succeed at what they do, that their company will be the next tech giant? No one really believes that.</p><figure name="d3dc" id="d3dc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*fpYRcy5A_LQ6NXER.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="300" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/misconceptions-300x300.jpg" alt="misconceptions" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fpYRcy5A_LQ6NXER.jpg"></figure><p name="5557" id="5557" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Of the hundreds of startups, 99% believe that their idea stands out — that in no time they will make billions. But most startups struggle just to get an initial investment. All that matters to them is their idea. Many startup CEOs fallaciously believe that investors look for just an idea. However, there are many more factors — a business plan, projected growth, burn rate, estimated stock value etc — that investors look at before putting up money in new companies — after all they also want to make money for themselves. Without having plans for the future and a proper , they can’t possibly get an investment, or turn their company into a profit — let alone be productive.</p><p name="2847" id="2847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world out there is a battlefield and not everyone survives. People shouldn’t think of a startup until they have a plan of action — not just technologically, but economically as well. After all, it is a business that they’re trying to run.</p><p name="bd4e" id="bd4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">-Sameer Chadha</p></div></div></section>
