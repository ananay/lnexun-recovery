Microsoft Zune was introduces in the US market as a 30 GB model on November 14, 2006, with a price tag of $249.99.<br><br>Zune comes equipped with a 30 GB hard drive, built-in FM tuner with Radio Data System, 3.0-inch screen, and Wi-Fi networking. For audio, Zune supports MP3, WMA and AAC. Zune supports Microsoft’s WMV movie format, and the Zune software will transcode MPEG4 and H.264 video to synchronize onto the device.<br><br>The key difference between Zune and other competing players is its Zune-to-Zune Wi-Fi feature which enables the limited sharing of songs, recordings, playlists and pictures with others. Tracks received from another person can be played for up to three days or three plays, whichever comes first, after which it expires unless purchased or downloaded via the Zune Marketplace online. <br><br>For those of you who have been awfully good in the past and whose parents have made the awful mistake of buying you an Xbox 360, I have good news and that is that Zune syncs up with the 360 and hence gives you an all round entertainment experience if your TV is connected with Bose speakers or the like. Imagine….Bliss.<br><br>Another key feature in the Zune is the fact that its wall paper can be changed to any user-specified image which is something that’s isn’t possible in an ipod. Weighing only 160 grams the Zune can turn out to be the iPod killer in the distant future if Microsoft spends heavily on advertising and coming up with “cool” advertisements, which is highly unlikely.<br><br>Anyhoo, Cnet gives the gadget an 8 which is quite good. So, if don’t own a portable media player as of yet, you do have one more option rather than one less to jump onto the bandwagon.<br><br>Stay Tuned<br><br> — Manas</p></div></div></section>
