All in all, a wonderful movie, Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by Ben Burtt, that resemble voices. It is also quite interesting to note that Wall-E runs Mac OS.<br><br>“By the early 22nd century, the mega corporation Buy n Large took control of every economic service on Earth, causing excessive worldwide consumerism to cover the planet in un-recycled trash. A plan was proposed that would have the Earth’s population evacuate the planet into space on fully automated luxury star liners where they would spend the next five years while an army of waste disposal robots called “WALL-E” (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) would be left behind to clean the planet. This plan failed, however, and the planet was deemed uninhabitable. For the next 700 years, humanity continued to live in space while all of the WALL-E robots on Earth broke down except for one; this lone unit still performs his duties but, after centuries of prolonged activation, has developed sentience and a sense of curiosity, as shown by his habit of collecting knickknacks among the trash (as well as spare parts for himself), and his fascination with the old musical film Hello, Dolly!.<br><br>Subsequently, Wall-E falls into love with a probe robot EVE. Wall-E’s adventures then lead him to the luxury star liner, the axiom itself. The captain of the ship discovers Earth’s present state and realizes that humans must go back and rebuild human civilization on earth. Once they reach Earth, the humans and robots begin working together to restore their home.”</p></div></div></section>
