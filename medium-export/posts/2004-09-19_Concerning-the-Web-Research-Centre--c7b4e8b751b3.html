This is a notice for people who use the services of the eGurucool Lab under the Exun banner.<br><br><br><br><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Concerning Digex</em><br><br>Digex members have now localized on the computer known as ‘iMac’ and all their digital image processing work will be done on that computer. However, Ms. Sarika has mentioned that Digex members are only allowed to work in the computer laboratory for the first two periods. I kindly request Exun members not to disturb the Digex members during that time period, and utilize the functionality of the myriad other computers available in the laboratory for their work. I will leave all else information on an ambiguous basis.<br><br><br><br><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">About the eGurucool Lab</em><br><br>First of all, I would like you to recognize the meaning of the word ‘laboratory’. According to Google, it is “a workplace for the conduct of scientific research”. So, if you think your work comes under the above description, you are allowed to conduct it in the lab. In addition to this, the work should be related to Exun in some respect. For any other laboratory work, you must take written permission from a teacher. Again, I ask you to apply your mind and figure out which activities are not allowed in the lab; be prepared to get chucked out if you are seen ‘bunking’.<br><br><br><br><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">About emotional attachment with the iMac</em><br><br>I have seen many Exun members express some kind of attachment with the iMac (including a certain pride factor in using it); I would discourage such feelings, as it’s important to note that the iMac is only a computer. As far as I can tell, most Exun activities do not require the extra functionality available on a Mac. So, please be rational about this. Those who find this paragraph absurd — kindly ignore it.<br><br><br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Competitions</strong><br><br>There is a competition at Ahlcon Public School on the 29th and 30th of September and another at DPS Mathura Road in mid-October. Tomorrow, I will attempt, from school, to post information regarding the two events. Do comment on whether you would attend a competition in the middle of the exams or not.<br><br><br><br> — Karan</p></div></div></section>
