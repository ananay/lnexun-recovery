All of them executed their jobs flawlessly as was demanded. What we’ve got here is a talented bunch of people who are also ready to work really hard, which leads us to believe that the future of Exun is in safe hands. Bharat here deserves special mention. He was in school up till 8 in the evening, and we believe was one of the hardest working members this year.</p><p name="8bbc" id="8bbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vidur Butalia</strong><br>Vidur is Exun’s own Jimi Hendrix, much to Shashi maam’s dismay. A quizzing prodigy in the making, Vidur has helped Exun to bag various laurels this year. His fine command over the art of sarcasm is well known and appreciated by all. Vidur, for the lack of a better word, is an essential in the Exun community.</p><p name="58f3" id="58f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pratul Tandon</strong><br>Also an upcoming quizzer in the Delhi circuits, Pratul is sincere, hardworking and hungry- The reason why he wasn’t assigned the food duty. Jokes apart, Pratul has proved his quintessential mettle in the past and surely has potential for much more. Yet another fine chap to hang out with.</p><p name="21dc" id="21dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sibesh Kar</strong><br>Although he was unable to attend the event itself, Sibesh has a done a phenomenal job with the 3D model of the school in the Exun video. SidNangia v2.0 in the making.</p><p name="d2c5" id="d2c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rohan Nagpal</strong><br>Rohan has been instrumental in Exun quizzing this year. From random facts to heavy explanations, this guy knows it all. Kudos and keep it up.</p><p name="9810" id="9810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Barun Patra, Ishita Batra, Manas Jha,Mohit Sharma and Ishan Sharma</strong><br>The pupils of some well abled senior Exun programmers, these people have shown the ability to work efficiently and silently without any hiccups. Exun programmers have always required zero management and this remained true for Exun 2010 as well. Thumbs up to everyone here. Manas deserves a special mention since he completed his AVH duties, and ran around whenever asked to. He has been in our opinion one of the most consistent workers for Exun ever since he joined.</p><p name="bffd" id="bffd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Adideva Sekhri</strong><br>His first Exun, Adideva was a healthy blob of matter (Still is, arguable) bubbling with excitement (Still is, unarguable). We could write a paragraph here but all you need to know is this — this man holds within himself the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">real spirit of Exun</strong>.</p><p name="ab67" id="ab67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Eeshita Bajpai, Aishwarya Kane, Varnika Chawla and Devika Gupta</strong><br>These ladies are extremely versatile, from judge care to invitation follow ups, they did it all. We could assign them tasks and consider them done already. Electing to study different subjects than the usual PCM-C, they are a testimony to the fact that Exun is truly a multicultural student body. Aishwarya deserves special mention since she started on the invitation follow up days in advance.</p><p name="4f29" id="4f29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mayank Sharma</strong><br>Exun’s gladiator is one of the most feared gamers in Delhi, blazing several BYOC events behind him. Not only did he prove himself to be instrumental in finding sponsors but it was under his initiative that the gaming event at Exun 2010 was such a huge hit.</p><p name="49ae" id="49ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bhuwan Khattar</strong><br>The ultra-famous sciento-magician Effrafax of Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain Magramal entirely invisible.Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux-O-Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn’t going to make it.So, he and his friends, and his friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends’ friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what now is widely recognized as being the hardest night’s work in history, and, sure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible. Effrafax lost his bet — and therefore his life — simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal ought to be he didn’t trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking extra moon.</p><p name="0be3" id="0be3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Effrafax really needed was Bhuwan Khattar. The man who gets jobs done. Period.<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Tanay Padhi, Subham Goel and Rishabh Marya</strong><br>Each of these people definitely deserves a separate acknowledgement. But we won’t, simply because they have always been the three musketeers in our head. They form the backbone of this club and we look forward to Exun achieving even greater heights of success under their guidance next year. &lt;After giving us a temporary scare, Shubham has returned to his rightful title of ‘The Gentle Giant (v3.0)’&gt;</p><p name="5ed1" id="5ed1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Achal Verma</strong><br>Achal has done a phenomenal job in reviving Digex and the digital imaging spirit within Exun which had been lying dormant since quite sometime. A soft spoken chap who is always ready to work.</p><p name="b868" id="b868" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Shardendu Gautam</strong><br>John Travolta:Samuel Jackson::Mayank Sharma:Shardendu Gautam<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Abhisheik Kumar and Tanya Makker</strong><br>Even though both of them are not a part of the Clan, it felt as though they were. Thank you for coming for Exun 2010! The entire Clan would like to thank both of you.</p><p name="ad05" id="ad05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sakshi Gupta, Karanveer Mohan &amp; Anand Khare</strong><br>Well, what can we say about them. The programming and Swat the bug events were what they were because of them. Right from the beginning of the year Karanveer also took on to train the juniors, and ensured that well deserving ones were inducted into Exun. Sakshi is one of our senior most members, and her experience and help has always been appreciated. Anand was constantly there leading up to the days to the event; sometimes even leaving at 8 in the evening.</p><p name="f3cf" id="f3cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vaibhav Bhatla</strong><br>Vaibhav really helped out prior to the event with the setting up of the Quiz &amp; the Crossword events. He’s one of those members who silently work in the back ground. He was always ready to take up responsibilities many of which were thrust upon him last minute.</p><p name="ed49" id="ed49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sobhagya Jose, Dhananjay Goel &amp; Aditya Somani</strong><br>They carried out the tasks assigned to them with perfection, and were always willing to help out with any tasks required of them. Aditya and Varun also carried out their gaming duties very well ensuring that all went smoothly.</p><p name="3cbb" id="3cbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Varun Dubey</strong><br>One man army.</p><p name="83a8" id="83a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Srijit Ghosh</strong><br>Srijit did an amazing job with the Under_Score this year. Right from the beginning of the year, he could be seen pestering people on their facebook walls for articles. He was always ready to sweat it out for the club, and even learnt Corel Draw in a matter of days to compile the magazine.The result? Pure Awesomeness! We really missed him during the event.</p><p name="ad4e" id="ad4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pranav Prem Kapoor</strong><br>Pranav is one of the most dedicated people we have over here at Exun. He was at the registration desk, right from the start of day one till the end of day two. He is a perfectionist, and even the lure of watching the quiz finals couldn’t move him from his designated place.</p><p name="31c2" id="31c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aman Agarwal, Aditya Agarwalla, Sanchit Abrol &amp; Tushar Bhasin</strong><br>All four of them were indispensable during the two days. They are people you can count upon to get the job done, and that too quickly. Despite their first Exun, Aditya and Sanchit were of great help. Aman &amp; Tushar handled the programming, and AVH duties flawlessly.</p><p name="b90a" id="b90a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Palash Jain &amp; Utkarsh Agrawal</strong><br>Recently inducted into Exun, both of them are extremely sincere people. They were assigned lab supervision duties and they carried them out without a fault.</p><p name="d178" id="d178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Akshay Sawhney &amp; Manvi Arora</strong><br>They were helpful during the event, and never said no for any tasks assigned to them. Kudos!</p><p name="66a8" id="66a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pratham Agrawal</strong><br>Pratham Agrawal; the man behind the Exun video.The video gets better each time you see it. We can’t say enough about what Exun has gained from him. Be it the video, the cover for the magazine or just plain old banners, Pratham’s the go to man.</p><p name="cb7b" id="cb7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Joseph sir, Diny sir, Anup sir, Thomas sir</strong><br>These people help make us Exun what it is. They are an integral part of our club, and we cannot thank them enough for all the stay backs till late in the evening, and the other help. All of you guys are awesome !</p><p name="e3f9" id="e3f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Shankar Sir</strong><br>Shankar Sir is the Shepard to the bewildered sheep called Exun members. Sir has always been absolutely indispensable.</p><p name="56a7" id="56a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We would also like to thank all our teachers for their support and guidance-<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mohit Dey sir, Hema Ma’am, Anita Ma’am, Romi Ma’am, Sarika Ma’am, Manisha Ma’am, Sangeeta Ma’am, Nandini Ma’am, Ajithkumar sir, Shekhar Sir</strong>.</p><p name="d81d" id="d81d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And Finally</p><p name="0474" id="0474" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mukesh Sir</strong><br>You know when sir reads it, he probably won’t like it because he never likes to take credit for what he does, and just passes it all down onto us. There’s nothing really that can describe him which will fit in here, so we’ll end with a quote this man lives by<br>“Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.”</p><p name="8de2" id="8de2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The Presidents<br>Aditya, Kush &amp; Diwank</p></div></div></section>
