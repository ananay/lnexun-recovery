Bill Gates earns US$250 every SECOND, that’s about US$20 Million a DAY and US$7.8 Billion a YEAR!<br><br>2. If he drops a thousand dollars, he won’t even bother to pick it up bcoz during the 4 seconds he picks it, he would’ve already earned it back.<br><br>3. The US national debt is about 5.62 trillion dollars, if Bill Gates were to pay the debt by himself; he will finish it in less then 10 years.<br><br>4. He can donate US$15 to everyone on earth but still be left with US$ 5 Million for his pocket money.<br><br>5. Michael Jordan is the highest paid athlete in US. If he doesn’t drink and eat, and keeps up his annual income i.e. US$30 Million, he’ll have to wait for 277 years to become as rich as Bill Gates is now.<br><br>6. If Bill Gates was a country, he would be the 37th richest country on earth.<br><br>7. If you change all of Bill Gate’s money to US$1 notes, you can make a road from the earth to moon, 14 times back and forth.<br><br>But you have to make that road non-stop for 1,400 years, and use a total of 713 BOEING 747 planes to transport all the money.<br><br>8. Bill Gates is 40 this year. If we assume that he will live for another 35 years, he has to spend US$6.78 Million per day to finish all his money before he goes to heaven.<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><br>Last but not the least : The Best One !!<br><br>9.If Microsoft Windows’ users can claim US$1 for every time their computers hang because of Microsoft Windows, Bill Gates will be bankrupted in 3 years!!!!!!!!<br></strong><br><br>Note: This came to me as a forwarded message and thus I am not responsible if any of the facts are wrong. But definitely the last fact should not be wrong!!</p></div></div></section>
