More than 400 teams from schools in and around Delhi participated in the event. Three teams from school had participated, which are equally good but sadly only one team could qualify per school. And as a matter of fact, I have a feeling that only one team from all Delhi Public Schools qualified for the finals.<br><br>Let me introduce that team for you<br>1. Gursartaj Singh Nijjar<br>2. Dhruv Kumar<br><br>And now let me also introduce the winner of the award for the most stupid person on Earth<br>1. Dhruv Kumar<br><br>Dhruv Kumar conveniently decided to go home since the results were taking too much time. And when our team qualified I was left with no other choice but to go on stage alone.<br><br>The Quizmaster was Mr. Giri “PickBrain” Subramaniam. He was a fine chap except when it came to cracking jokes.<br><br>The preliminary round consisted of 20 questions which were quite simple according to many of the regular quizzers, and we later found out that all the finalists were separated by just 1 point.<br><br>Then, it was time for the finals. 6 teams qualified to battle it out on stage-<br>1. Amity International, Gurgaon<br>2. Mother’s International School<br>3. Sardar Patel Vidyalaya<br>4. Amity International, Saket<br>5. Apeejay, Noida<br>6. DPS, RKP!!!!!<br><br>I will again remind that Dhruv had decided to ditch me. Dhruv is in trouble. Period.<br><br>The quiz had 6 rounds, three of them being buzzer rounds.<br>The first two rounds were a bit of a letdown with our team scoring just 20 points and MIS and Sardar Patel getting way ahead of us. The “Lone Warrior”(thats what the quizmaster decided to call me) was in third position practically throughout the quiz. And well, that was the case almost till the end of the quiz. But a quiz is never over till the last question and thats exactly what happened.<br><br>It was the last round, 2 questions left. Tension was thick. Blood Pressure High.<br>Sardar Patel 70<br>MIS 50<br>RKP 35<br><br>It was a buzzer round, with each question worth 15 points but it was -10 if you got it wrong<br>The question is on the screen, the tension is too much. The lone warrior presses the buzzer and answers only to be greeted by a very surprised look on Pickbrain’s face almost killing the lone warrior. However, the surprised look was overpowered by the applause of the audience as the lone warrior was right.<br>MIS 50<br>RKP 50<br>So close.<br><br>The competition between MIS and RKP now.<br>The question is again on the screen. The lone warrior doesnt wait for the Pickbrain, presses the buzzer, pauses for a second and answers. The pickbrain tries the trick with the surprised look again. But alas, the lone warrior knows he is right and the audience just goes into fits of overwhelmed applause. The lone warrior has done it. He does it for DPS RKP.<br>DPS RKP manage second position and the final score was 65, just 5 points behind Sardar Patel and thus missing the national finals at Mumbai.<br><br>But wait, it wasnt over yet. The Pickbrain and everyone from TCS are just flabbergasted and they have no words for the Lone Warrior.<br>The Lone Warrior is declared as the “Gladiator of IT Quizzing of Delhi”.. *takes a bow*<br><br>Plus, I will be flying to Mumbai to witness the Finals and probably have dinner with the CEO of TCS, Mr. Ramodorai(I dont know the spelling)<br><br>And I forgot about the prizes.<br>We received<br>1. iPod Nano 2 GB<br>2. Tata Indicom Mobile Connection<br>3. A Titan Fastrack Watch<br>4. And lots of other Goodiess..<br><br>I hope next year, our team qualifies and both the participants are present on stage and they win the regional finals and then win the National Finals as well.<br><br>Till then<br>G</p></div></div></section>
