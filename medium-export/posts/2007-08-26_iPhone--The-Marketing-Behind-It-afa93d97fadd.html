A lot has been said about its features, the ones available as well as those missing. In my opinion, apart from the product itself, the beauty of the iPhone lies in its extremely innovative marketing and its capability to completely change the telecom industry.<br><br>The iPod is well known for redefining the marketing of music. With the iPhone, Apple is set to redefine the telecom industry as well. Instead of launching three to four new devices every couple of months, telecom manufacturers will be now looking to release one product with significant technological advances in a considerable span of time.<br><br>In the marketing, the first thing that Apple did was take control of iPhone activation. Conventionally, it is the telecom operator and not the manufacturer that activates a connection. With the iPhone, however, one will have to log in through iTunes and then activate the iPhone. This is an ingenious method for further spreading the word about iTunes!<br><br>Version 1 of the iPhone has been severely criticized for missing several basic features. The immediate question that arises is: Why would Apple make an inferior product? The answer to this lies in the fact that Apple is already working on the iPhone’s next version. Experts feel that its next version will have all these faults rectified and probably be the smartest phone ever. Had Apple launched a complete Version 1, it would reach a saturation point in sales, leaving no room for further growth. Instead now, when the next version is launched, it would be like launching a new product altogether!<br><br>These are just two points in the iPhone’s ground-breaking marketing and sales, which is in fact a step further in Apple’s strategy that besides the product, its marketing should also be revolutionary!</p></div></div></section>
