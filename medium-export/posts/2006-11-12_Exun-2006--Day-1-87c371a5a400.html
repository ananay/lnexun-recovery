Participants from schools from all over Delhi battled it out in the Senior Quiz Prelims, Junior Quiz Prelims, Crossword Prelims, the Group Discussion Prelims , Swat the Bug and the Surprise Event. The finals for the Group Discussion were also held yesterday by the judges, Vibhas and Viksit. The results for all events conducted on Day 1 are available <a href="http://exunclan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=39" data-href="http://exunclan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=39" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>Registration started at 9:00 AM and was followed by the Inauguration, which was attended by the Principal, the Vice Principal, Mr. Mukesh Kumar, the entire computer department, Mr. Nitin Hiranandani (he was also the Chief Guest for the occassion) and of course all the participants.<br>Immediately after the inauguration, the events started.

HardOC continues a trend of starting new events, as Exun always strives to create new standards and set benchmarks rather than follow them. This trend started with Swat the Bug, which is now a regular event at any Exun symposium. <a href="http://exunclan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;amp;amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=39" data-href="http://exunclan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;amp;amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=39" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click here to find out who won this new event.</a><br><br>The points tally shows that Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj has taken the overall lead and it is being closely followed by Apeejay Noida. Day 2 will witness Programming, Crossword finals, the Junior Quiz finals and the Senior Quiz finals. By the end of the day, one team will win the overall trophy. Who will it be?<br>Be there on Day 2 of Exun 2006 — eX marks the Spot!</p></div></div></section>
