That’s because it’s true. For decades, Exun has had a work ethic and a spirit of teamwork that’s hard to rival.<br><br>We’re not exaggerating when we say that this is where we learned the most in school. We learnt how to follow our leaders, and how to lead ourselves. We learnt how to be responsible for an ideal, and to be a part of something bigger than all of us. From Mukesh Sir, who is perhaps the best example of a mentor and a leader-by-example, all the way to our newest junior inductee, there is an unwritten process of give and take, wherein we teach others what we learn, and learn by what others teach.</p><figure name="17ec" id="17ec" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Kzzryj6UffZcl0Cb.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="300" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Exun-Dynamic-300x300.jpg" alt="exun-dynamic" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Kzzryj6UffZcl0Cb.jpg"></figure><p name="6816" id="6816" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Honestly, I’ve never seen this done more open-heartedly. Nowhere else have I seen such a huge organization where all of its members and leaders, without exception, believe in the collective good, whether it’s through the spread of benevolent technology, or just witnessed in an interaction between members of this family. Because that is what it feels like to be a part of Exun: it’s like one big family. We make mistakes, we run late, we ask favors of each other, and sometimes fail to live up to our own and others’ expectations of us. But at the end of the day, we’re all there for each other, and we realize that all this is a necessary part of our journey, that this is how we grow and become better at what we do, provided we are always open to learning and changing ourselves.</p><p name="59ab" id="59ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I learnt a very important personal lesson as well from Mukesh Sir himself, and I see it embodied in the best of Exun’s people and work.
