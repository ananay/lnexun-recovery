Although Apple completely rewrote the millions of lines of code comprising the Mac OS from scratch for version 10, I think that both Apple and Microsoft have moved in a terribly wrong direction.</p><p name="285a" id="285a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mac OS X<br><br>To a certain extent Mac OS X’s interface is very good indeed. For example, the buttons for closing, maximizing and minimizing a window are marked with distinct colours. Also, ExposÃ© along with anti-aliasing make Mac OS X a really sweet sight. Now many of you may disagree with me on this, but I find two very basic things in Mac OS X to be fatally flawed:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="a499" id="a499" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The Dock</li><li name="3580" id="3580" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Minimizing and Maximizing</li></ol><p name="3c18" id="3c18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">By default the dock is at the bottom of the screen where it takes up more than 1/10th of the screen, and that vertical space becomes completely unusable. Secondly, the bouncing action of the icons (by default, it can be changed) when an application starts is really kiddish and one gets fed up of it pretty soon. Minimizing: firstly, all software don’t support the standard Apple-M keyboard shortcut for it (for example, FireFox doesn’t) and secondly, once you send a window into the Dock, there’s no way of maximizing it again with a keyboard shortcut. This is, in a word — bugging. These are not all of the GUI troubles with Mac OS X, there are many more, but these tend to bug you a lot in regular everyday use.</p><p name="daeb" id="daeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Windows<br><br>There’s no point in arguing that Windows XP wasn’t inspired by Mac OS X, because it definitely was. I have no qualms with the Windows interface. In fact, I happen to believe it as being one of the most well-designed and most accessible user interfaces, beating Mac OS (elegant though it may be) and Linux (really not a challenge) in many many areas. When I see the Windows UI, the word that comes to my mind is “efficient” — this is the UI you want to work on, compared to the word “cool” that comes to my mind when I think of Mac OS X. Windows XP was supposed to look cool; however, I think that if you ever get around to doing serious work on XP, you almost always switch back to the Classic (Windows 95 to 2000) look, simply because it’s just more efficient, and those jazzy animations, shadows and transparency really don’t help at all.</p><p name="ac96" id="ac96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Mac OS 9<br><br>“Ultrafast, Efficient” come to my mind. The OS 9 (or Classic) GUI beats the Mac OS X, Windows and Linux GUI in every area. It is the most usable thing on this planet. In fact, it’s always been a major reason for the fact that Macs were used extensively in graphics and video development (Intel’s ads were until recently made on Macs). Not only that, but with all its efficiency, it’s also much better, more space saving and easier to use than the current Windows or Mac OS X GUI. If somebody could just slap the Classic GUI on top of Windows or Mac OS X, I would be the happiest person on this planet.<br><br><br><br> — Karan</p></div></div></section>
