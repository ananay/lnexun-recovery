Come October 14, 10 am PST and the new MacBook will be out. But wait, is it a new Macbook? Now here is where things go a lil nutty. According to engadget, Apple has secretly created an entirely new manufacturing process. Apparently, Apple has created a brand-new process to sculpt casings for products out of aircraft-grade aluminum, using a system that carves the pieces out of a single block of metal using “3D lasers” and water-jet cutting. The new technique will supposedly allow for seamless components which require no bending or folding, won’t use screws to join together, are ultra-light but also “super strong,” and will enable the company to rapidly prototype and produce new designs. This is a rumor but rumors on engadget have been coming true time and again.</p><p name="e44d" id="e44d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coming over to the invite (the picture) it was quite surprising. Apple has been known to be all cryptic and mystic in their invites. Never before have they simply pointed out what new products they plan to unveil.</p><p name="8aed" id="8aed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why this Invite? Well IMHO, the sheer reason for that is Apple’s falling stock prices (taking in mind everybody in Wall Street is taking a beating these days). Prices have gone down by almost $85 in the past 3 months.</p><p name="60c7" id="60c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well lets wait and watch what ol Jobs has in store (pun intended) for us.</p><p name="823f" id="823f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">UPDATE: Guys, the puzzle fits perfectly. I’ve been reading some insider news and I’m quite sure these are Apple’s steps towards creating a manufacturing process which would free them of the chains that bind them to Chinese/Taiwanese manufacturers like Foxconn. Does the acquisition of PA Semi ring a bell?</p></div></div></section>
