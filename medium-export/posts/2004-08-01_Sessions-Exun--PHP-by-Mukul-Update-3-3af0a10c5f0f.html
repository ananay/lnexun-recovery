So, we have two tentative dates now, which are Thursday the 5th and Friday the 6th (same time : 1.30pm). I would like comments from the people who want to attend so that we can decide on the most favourable date.<br><br><br><br>A recap for those who haven’t read about <a href="http://www.exunclan.com/logexun/2004/07/sessionsexun.html" data-href="http://www.exunclan.com/logexun/2004/07/sessionsexun.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sessions@Exun</a> or more specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PHP</a>. The idea of Sessions@Exun was conceived so that interested people may learn a specific skill in computers from people who have already learnt that skill and are experienced in it. This helps because reading big, fat books is tedious and sometimes if the book is technical, then confusing as well. Teachers are always better than books anyway.<br><br><br><br>More specifically PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is an HTML-embedded scripting language, which means that it is used for serving dynamic content on web pages, just like ASP. The only difference (usage-wise) between ASP and PHP is that ASP is a Microsoft product and needs a Windows Server to run on while PHP is Open Source and can run on any OS. And since Linux is being more widely deployed these days, it makes more sense to learn PHP if you’re doing Server-Side Scripting. I am told that PHP is tougher than ASP, but since I have no knowledge of PHP (I’m counting on this Session myself), I can’t say anything about that.</p><p name="5680" id="5680" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">About Mukul: Many people have asked me who Mukul is, so let me introduce him. Mukul is an Exun alumnus, currently studying at Iowa State University (US). He is here in Delhi for his summer break and has found time to give us an introduction to PHP, which he says is his mother tongue.<br><br><br><br>Please comment away people. We want to know who’s coming and what day is more favourable — Thursday or Friday.<br><br><br><br> — Karan<br><br><br><br>PS: Any student of DPS RK Puram can attend, not just Exun members.</p></div></div></section>
