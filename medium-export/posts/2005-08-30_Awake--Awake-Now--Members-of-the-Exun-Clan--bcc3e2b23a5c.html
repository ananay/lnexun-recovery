Awake Now… Members of the Exun Clan!</h3><p name="75c8" id="75c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">We’ve probably said this a million times, but we’ll say it again — you are a member of Experts Unlimited if and only if you are an Expert Unlimited, and Experts Unlimited are:<br><br>a) those who are the best at what they do, and<br>b) those who stay the best<br><br>Either a or b won’t do — you need both. And if you don’t comply with this, please be prepared to leave Exun because you’re no longer an Exun. One of the happiest things we got done in Exun last year was to get the “Once in, not out” rule abolished. There were some members who didn’t get selected by us specifically and were not upto the mark. The need for downsizing might arrive again, and soon. We used to complain about Exun a lot in classes ninth and tenth, because, even after repeatedly trying to get in, they just wouldn’t accept us as members. But now we realize how important that was. For one, now we look back and see that getting into Exun was an achievement, and, after getting in, there was hardly a single day in school on which we didn’t do something Exun-related.<br><br>Is a member active simply because he/she shows his face in the lab everyday, asks stupid questions, checks his email (or complains about the Internet not working) and goes away? No! And if you do/think that, you’re wasting your time and damaging the clan. Everyone needs to take up some project or pursue some idea or another. A lot of the members simply stand in the sidelines and watch, and this is sad because Exun should simply not have any sidelines at all. If you want to stand in the sidelines and watch, you simply should not be in Exun at all. <br><br>Dpshelpforum.com is a great initiative by Dhruv Agrawal and other members should also similarly introduce their ideas into the real world. Unfortunately, dpshelpforum.com is also the only initiative I’ve seen this year, and that says a lot about what’s going on… or not.<br><br>So go on… show us whatcha got!<br><br> — Karan &amp; Maanick</p></div></div></section>
