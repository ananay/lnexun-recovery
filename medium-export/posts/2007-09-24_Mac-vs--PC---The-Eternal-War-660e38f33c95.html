I could have done it on my experience and feelings on getting in, but Shubham already did that and it would be very lame to do another similar article.</p><p name="716e" id="716e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now we all know about the war that has been on for almost three decades, Mac vs. PC. OK, true Apple made the GUI, Windows copied it. But note this down people, Bill Gates with all his cheap business tactics made it popular. It is also an established fact that more people are using Windows as compared to Mac (Though I can swear Mac is way better than Windows). I guess one very important reason for this is that Apple lost out on many of the important years that mark the GUI’s growth (Thanks Sculley!). Maybe Apple could have used those years to gain a wider a market base.</p><p name="2e31" id="2e31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another very important reason is PIRACY. Almost every kind of software that Microsoft makes is available at much cheaper prices in areas I can’t name. Why don’t we have Mac software being sold on such a wide scale? Well, basically because in terms of compatibility Mac is not all universal. So what if Mac OS Leopard is gonna cost only $129 whereas Windows Vista Ultimate costs $416? Leopard isn’t gonna install on your PC. I am a true Apple fan, but if I can’t run Leopard on my computer ( and boy I can’t afford an iMac) , I have to do with what Microsoft has to offer ( which is not much ).</p><p name="4926" id="4926" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So what Apple should do (I can bet they won’t do it) is to make Mac more compatible. I hope in the distant future I will be able to run Mac on my computer and won’t have to do with a version that needs a patch file, a whole lot of changes, etc. C’mon Apple, you made the iPod a phenomenon, can’t you do this much? (Do it for all your fans Apple, those who canât afford your products, whose prices are apparently decided by “Idiots”)</p></div></div></section>
