Exun’s motto truly defined the time I spent as part of the clan, because I never did anything alone! Dhruv (Kumar), Abhishek (Suri), and I, joined Exun together in 2001 and never looked back.</p><p name="c7b4" id="c7b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back then, we had no idea what Exun was, we had just heard about 2 seniors who bagged a foreign visit because they made a website, and Suri got us together. We went straight to Mrs. Chona (our principal at the time), and she directed us to Mukesh Sir. After a few failed attempts at making a website using Windows 95, Internet Explorer 5, our broken knowledge of HTML and Floppy Disks, we decided to abandon the project. However, given all three of us, for some odd reason, knew C++ at the time, Mukesh Sir decided to test us, but we failed miserably there as well. We must’ve tried for 2 months to clear his test, but couldn’t! He still took us in. I made it by default with Dhruv and Suri, even though I’d stopped going to the meetings with Sir.</p><p name="fa17" id="fa17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Exun used to be extremely selective and very small at the time (28 members at the time), and we were extremely lucky to have made it. We spent the first year behind the scenes, lifting boxes, chairs, monitors and everything in our way! We didn’t even participate in any event for the first year. This was our first lesson in patience and looking back, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Over the years, we worked extremely hard, participated in and won several events, had the time of our lives and made life long friendships. In class 12, Dhruv and I were chosen as Presidents, a dream we held since the day we joined, and I don’t think I could’ve asked for a better partner. I credit Dhruv for coming up with several new initiatives including Under_Score and a Quiz book (which never saw the light of day but is 200 pages of quizzing awesomeness). Exun was probably the best part of my school life, and I certainly miss it to this day.</p><p name="3b19" id="3b19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though I was really young, and it was a long time ago, Exun has left an indelible impression on me. It was really something that gave us life lessons. The biggest lesson that none of us can ever forget is teamwork. We, not I is not just there for the sake of it. Mukesh Sir has made sure it is entrenched in our DNA, and every Exun member swears by it. Even with old alumni, this is what connects us and doesn’t bring any barriers between us.</p><figure name="f6cd" id="f6cd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*M6uQZcqGdlmIZrUW.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="300" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gursartaj-300x300.jpg" alt="gursartaj" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*M6uQZcqGdlmIZrUW.jpg"></figure><p name="3c93" id="3c93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Second, I learnt about humility and integrity. There were a few times when we were bragging about our wins and the work we were doing, and Mukesh Sir was quick to step in and put a bit of sense into us. To this day, each time I feel myself straying, takes me back to Mukesh Sir’s words. We also had immense responsibility, because our teachers put immense trust in us with confidential data and processes, and none of us ever thought of breaking that trust.</p><p name="fba8" id="fba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Last but not least, my biggest lesson was really the thrill of being the underdog. My life’s motivation has always come from being the underdog, when I’ve been at the lowest and then with confidence and grit made it back. Amongst all the events we did that, the one that is etched in memory is TCS IT Wiz 2006. Dhruv and I, somehow managed to qualify amongst 700 other amazing teams, and then Dhruv decided to vanish (because he hadn’t told his mom he was going for the quiz, and never imagined he would qualify). I was amongst the finalist teams, alone! And was nowhere in contention till the last round, but the Exun spirit (and crowd support), kept me alive and I managed to place second (Dhruv was there in spirit)! All alone! That was the moment I realized that nothing is impossible and one should never give up. And the very next day, we went for another quiz where we didn’t even manage to qualify. (talk about highs and lows!)</p><p name="e770" id="e770" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Years later, when I was sitting for job interviews, I went through 4 terrible interviews and had almost given up, and had only last chance to secure a job. Even during the interview, things were not going too well and the interviewer had already interrupted me twice, but I managed to get through it and got the offer!</p><p name="01c5" id="01c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the years, my exun classmates have gone on to become Watchmakers at Apple, and amazing engineers and I steered off to work at a bank, but our friendship is intact. We always pick up from where we left off, usually over a bucket of KFC!</p><p name="f227" id="f227" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am also absolutely blown away by the things that the current batch of Exun members is achieving. I feel out of place when I meet all of them! It’s truly awe-inspiring, keep up the good work guys!</p><p name="1d33" id="1d33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s to forever being an EXpert Unlimited!</p><p name="0ac2" id="0ac2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">WE, not I.</p><p name="0676" id="0676" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Gursartaj</p></div></div></section>
