This is called the binary system, wherein 0 means off, 1 means on. Although computers perform extremely complex calculations, it all starts here. This simple base soon evolves into rather complicated structures. But this system is reaching its limit with transistors reaching the size of an atom, beyond which this system won’t work(due to a phenomenon called quantum tunneling) thus proving Moore’s Law (in a year processors will be become twice as fast at the same cost) invalid.</p><p name="de2d" id="de2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Quantum System of Computing</strong></p><p name="1f0a" id="1f0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the quantum system, transistors are traded in for electrons. Electrons have 2 “spin” states (like a 0 and 1), but unlike tradition computers, electrons attain a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">superposition</strong> when they are not observed. They can be in both states at the same time. Sounds crazy, right? If we utilize this property, operations would be exponentially faster, to the tune of a 100 million times our current speed!</p><p name="c0d4" id="c0d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Quantum Leap</strong></p><p name="ba67" id="ba67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In traditional computers, each transistor has 2 states.

Sorry, no faster video-streaming or such. Also if you see the requirements of a quantum computer you will see that probably exceeds your budget by a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">lot</strong>. Seriously.</p><p name="b8ce" id="b8ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Challenge</strong></p><p name="73f4" id="73f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge is to effectively use the quantum</p><p name="1a85" id="1a85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">property of superposition. Unlike our home computers, which are cooled by fans, the quantum computers need to be cooled with cryogenic machines. The quantum processors themselves require very less space and wattage and aren’t very expensive and it is actually the cryogenic engines which require huge amounts of storage, wattage and money(to construct as well as to maintain) and so each quantum computer costs millions of dollars unlike on our everyday computers which are cheap(comparatively). The cost therefore has to be brought down.</p><p name="4315" id="4315" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Race for Quantum Supremacy</strong></p><p name="ec88" id="ec88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The race for quantum “supremacy” is the one to build a proper quantum computer. Google and IBM are the leaders in the race for quantum supremacy. They have been trying to make their own quantum computer and Google has recently created its own quantum chip, though it is still pretty primitive. IBM, which has also been creating one, has opened it up publicly for people to use through their cloud interface. This is only for consumers who have an idea of the use of quantum computing, not a regular home software. Also right now their quantum computers are extremely primitive so they can only perform very specific tasks.</p><p name="ba49" id="ba49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion</strong></p><p name="1b5b" id="1b5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So you see we can’t safely say that we will have proper quantum computers in the immediate future. But we’re getting there.</p><p name="2055" id="2055" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Written by:</strong><br>ASHVIN VERMA (7-K), ASHAY SRIVASTAVA (7-I), ANGAD SINGH (7-C)</p></div></div></section>
