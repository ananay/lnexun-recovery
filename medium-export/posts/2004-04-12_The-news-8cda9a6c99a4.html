Shame on the other President and the other thirty or so members.<br><br><br><br>In the news, the three of us Exun appointees have to go for the March Past just like the rest of them appointees. I wouldn’t really mind doing it, because it’s not really something that involves a lot of physical exertion or anything, however, it does require me to miss classes, something that I’m vehemently against. Fortunately, the Investiture Ceremony is now in August (assumably on the day of the Independence Day assembly). We did get our badges. I’ll probably scan them or take a photo of them and post it on either this log or my blog. They had the option of choosing from a Rs. 20 and a Rs. 25 badge, they however, went for the Rs. 5 badge or so I like to call it. It’s plain bad, and looks CHEAP — made of cloth, golden border, sickly green background and Orange text.<br><br><br><br>The school has been getting new PCs recently, and I’m glad to say that Mr. Mukesh has finally got a beautiful black HP PC (though crap config, 2.8 GHz and a paltry 248 MB RAM, 8 MB shared with Video). As expected, I knew he’d be sad because he has to run Windows XP now, and like, Windows 98 is the second love of his life. He never fails to tell me (whenever I touch this topic) that Windows 98 gives you full control while Windows XP and all seem to control you. I’d usually tell him that it’s a load of bull and that’s what I did today as well.<br><br><br><br> — Karan</p></div></div></section>
