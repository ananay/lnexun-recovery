Teams must bring their projects on CDs, Floppies (though avoid using floppies as far as possible) or any other portable storage medium. Teams are requested to bring along the necessary drivers and additional software (if any) to run their storage devices. Go present! PS: There seems to be a confusion about the topic. There is no topic. 30% marks on Originality and Concept. If you are unable to think of any good topic and want some suggestion, sure! Make it on: The Dark Side of Internet.

The software provided shall be Fruity Loops (double wink!).</p><p name="12d3" id="12d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Special Event</strong><br><br>Eligibility: Open | No. of participants: The entire team<br><br>You’re not going to get any info on this! Its a special event. Just look out for hints here and there in the site, as well as during the event. Of course, you’ll be told what the special event is during the inauguration on the first day, so make sure you’re there on time. And keep checking this page for some new hints and clues. One very important clue shall be put up on this page 2 days before the event and the schools need to solve it and come prepared to give the answer right after the inauguration. This shall be very useful, as you’ll be able to get a better understanding of the event if you have solved the clue. ;-)</p><p name="672b" id="672b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Please visit at :<br><br><a href="http://www.ramjasrkp.com/dynamix/dynamix.htm" data-href="http://www.ramjasrkp.com/dynamix/dynamix.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.ramjasrkp.com/dynamix/dynamix.htm</a></p><p name="5740" id="5740" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">for more details</p></div></div></section>
