Mooreâ€™s Law predicted that the processing power of computers would double every eighteen months, and boy, havenâ€™t those predictions come true!<br><br><br><br>In 1975, we could just begin to envisage what computers could do. Kenneth Olsen, President and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation remarked in 1977 that:<br><br>â€œThere is no reason for any individual to have a computer at home.â€�<br><br><br><br>â€œThe telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us,â€� said Western Union Internal Memo in 1876. <br><br><br><br>Today, computers, software and the internet are creating opportunities for people everywhere. It is expanding productivity, firing imaginations with creativity and putting dreams of people in their own hands!<br><br><br><br>The future promises to be brighter.<br><br><br><br>The clock dates the second of February, 2013 and itâ€™s my motherâ€™s birthday- her golden jubilee! I, at Harvard Business School, am miles away from home and my mother, my heart and soul making me passionate vis-Ã -vis giving my mother a revelation- a big one!<br><br> <br><br> Everyone in my family is connected over a 10Mbps satellite internet connection, a tera-hertz computer, a million pixel CCD video camera and shared calendars. I instantly fix up a time for the big one, when every one is at his terminal be it at home, work or school and blast! My potential, mindâ€™s imagination and creativity and tools were technologyâ€™s most precious gifts take me and my family into a virtual party with the presence of all loved ones. Sharing laughter, tears, memories and even a virtual dinner- technology gets it all happening — from different parts of the globe!<br><br><br><br>The future of technology shall have the most profound impact on the professional dimension of human life. Imagine I am the CEO of ArcTechÂ®, the largest architecture and design firm on the globe. I get a client with a great project at hand â€“ designing a 267-storied tall tower. The client talks over VoIP from the state of New York in the United States to me in my office in Taipei. The deal gets finalized and a contract summary expected by the client within the hour. I make a brief overview of the proposed project and share it with my Director of Operations at New York over optical-fiber video conferencing. Soon the officer contacts me back with the complete outline which is passed with amendments by the board and I put it back to the client. He approves, gets inspired by our on-time synchronized work and gives us two more projects. Thatâ€™s $1 billion worth of profit signed up for in just 44 minutes- by the clock! Isnâ€™t it work@thought, powered by technology?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> â€œA good teacher teaches,<br><br>A better teacher explains,<br><br>A great teacher demonstrates,<br><br>But the best one inspires!â€�<br><br><br><br>Information and communication technology shall help inspire the creative genius of potential Einsteins and Newtons and lead to more innovative and path breaking discoveries. A virtual classroom where even villagers are taught by some of the most renowned teachers on the earth (precise the purpose of Indiaâ€™s EDUSAT satellite), where live discussions is made through V-SAT classrooms and problems resolved by a virtual online community are all the future promises of technology.<br><br><br><br>Information and communication technology shall also redefine medical care by introducing telemedicine and e-consulting on a practical and accessible scale â€“ all contributions that shall make the world a global village<br><br><br><br>In short, how the growth of Information and Communication technology shall affect my future can be beautifully summarized in the following quatrain:<br><br><br><br>â€œTechnology indeed forms the backbone of the future-<br><br>Potential it has to heal and to nurture:<br><br>Time shall make grow to attain a new height;<br><br>And it shall make my future- happy, prosperous and bright!â€�<br><br><br><br><br><br> — Gopal</p></div></div></section>
