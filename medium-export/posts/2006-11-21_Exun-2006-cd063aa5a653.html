I would like to thank him for the humour he put into the whole event. Go Adi!</p><p name="4bdb" id="4bdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shubham Goel, Rishabh Marya and Tanay Padhi<br>These three new-comers did a phenomenal job. Every task assigned to them was completed on time and with great care. Their enthusiasm was inspiring. These three truly are among the rising stars of Exun. I am happy to say that the future of Exun is in safe hands.</p><p name="f77e" id="f77e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aditya Jain, R. Dwarkesh, Sobhagya Jose and Sakshi Gupta<br>Escort duty: One of the hardest and most demanding duties that can be given to an Exun member. It is the true test of an Exun member’s dedication and willingness to work. All of them passed this test with “flying colours”.</p><p name="ff94" id="ff94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Varun Khetarpal, Sahil Bajaj and Bharat Agarwal were responsible for updating the <a href="http://www.exunclan.com/" data-href="http://www.exunclan.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.exunclan.com</a> in real-time as the results for each event came out. With the able guidance of Varun, the persistence of Sahil and Bharat’s willingness to work, the website was always updated on time. Bharat who is traditionally not a “web” person, I’m sure, has discovered a new niche for himself in handling such tasks.</p><p name="ef10" id="ef10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ishaan Chugh, Akul Dayal, Anant Jain, Aayush Kumar, and Abhijit Das<br>They helped around everywhere, wherever they were needed. They even filled in at the registration desk, the help desk and even helped out with the famous food duty.</p><p name="066f" id="066f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Vansh Muttreja for managing the Help Desk with Rasagy and helping to coordinate the Group Discussion. Way to go Boy.</p><p name="be91" id="be91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rijul Jain and Ankit Srivastava handled Judge Care and judging by the judge’s happy faces, they must have done a brilliant job.</p><p name="0453" id="0453" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aviral Goyal and Gaurav Misra<br>Credit for all photographs and videos of Exun goes to Gaurav and Aviral, the two guys who could always be seen carrying a camera in their hands, clicking away relentlessly.</p><p name="d604" id="d604" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Utkarsh Ohm<br>Also on escort duty, Utkarsh managed the participants with aplomb. Guiding them from the registration desk to the AVH, he worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone knew where to go. His dedication also served as inspiration to everyone else.</p><p name="3d22" id="3d22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Kartikeya Asthana, Ananth Govind Rajan, Sajal Jain and Arjun Kumar<br>These are four new exun members who got in during Tech Quotient 2006. What’s really impressive about them is their team spirit and their ability to work hard, together.</p><p name="4ea9" id="4ea9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arshiya Sibia, Akriti Gaur, Kanika Singh and Mini Saxena<br>What impressed me most about them was their willingness to do any kind of job, and that coupled with their immense amount of enthusiasm to learn more and more. Great Job, Girls!!<br><br>Akshay Talwar and Srajan Mani<br>This inseparable duo of hardware fanatics conceived the HardOC event, in keeping with the Exun tradition of pioneering and setting trends rather than following them. They woke early, stayed up late and did everything within their capacity to make this new event a major success. Hats off to them.</p><p name="f921" id="f921" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shrey Verma and Radhika Malik<br>I actually have no words for them. They did their duty of the announcements and the speeches flawlessly.</p><p name="10fe" id="10fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Raghav Khullar<br>If you know Raghav Khullar, you’ll also know that it’s impossible to dampen his spirits. Come rain or storm, he was always there with a broad smile on his face. He assisted RG at the registration desk and ensured the whole process of registration was a breeze.</p><p name="a503" id="a503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Manas Gautam<br>Personally, I like to call him the Gentle Giant. Although physically tall, large and imperious, this guy was always accessible to everyone, including his juniors. His experience of organizing numerous events in the past, no doubt, helped him make the Gaming Event a successful one.</p><p name="cec6" id="cec6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Abhishek Suri — The Big One<br>He made a guest appearance on Sunday and stole the show. His ‘massive’ presence added to the event. Also, his massive presence ensured decorum at the Domino’s stall.</p><p name="7e74" id="7e74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rohit Garg — RG<br>I knew that he is beyond doubt the most resourceful person I have ever met. I also discovered that this thumb-drive wielding shy-guy is also dedicated and hard-working. He was at the Registration Desk, working away quietly at his terminal, without making a fuss about anything. Unfortunately, we didn’t hear him talk too much, though. As the famous saying goes, “RG is da man!”</p><p name="606d" id="606d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mohit Taneja<br>He’s obsessed with hardware. That’s why he was supervising the HardOC event. He was also on roaming duty, trying to iron out kinks that might have emerged in our otherwise well-oiled machine.</p><p name="d34b" id="d34b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">\n\n</p><p name="915a" id="915a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ah well, there is so much to say for this person, but so\nlittle space. He left his mark everywhere on Exun 2006. Let\’s just say that\nExun 2006 would never have been possible without him. I salute you, my friend.</p><p name="9fa2" id="9fa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">\n\n\n”,0] ); D([“ce”]); // →Siddharth Nangia — Sid<br>Ah well, there is so much to say for this person, but so little space. He left his mark everywhere on Exun 2006. Let’s just say that Exun 2006 would never have been possible without him. I salute you, my friend.Rasagy Sharma<br>Our very own Head of Programming. He’s also like the Jack of all Trades. He can probably do anything that you want him to do and this year he was asked to “man” the Help Desk. Sure enough, great job at that.<br><br>Now moving on to our teachers<br><br>Sangeeta Rana Ma’am and Shalini Harisukh Ma’am — thank you for managing the certificates. We didn’t have to worry about that part at all.<br><br>Suji Ma’am — Thank you for the great job with the opening ceremony(The credit for that actually goes to all teachers) and overall management of the event.<br><br>Anita Ma’am and Romi Ma’am- Thank you for helping out with the invigilation and the checking of papers. It really helps to have veterans around.<br><br>Mohit sir, Arbinda Sir and Sarika Ma’am — Thank you for helping out with the food duty(as always!)<br><br>Vijay Sir and Tiwari Sir- Yes, it is because of them that our event was successful. They stayed back in school to ensure we could get everything done. Thank you!<br><br>Joseph Sir, Diny Sir, Anup Sir and Thomas Sir- We are extremely grateful for their support with everything.<br><br>Shankar Sir- Probably the most indispensable person during Exun. You ask him for something, and you’ll get it without even worrying about it for a bit. Any words for him are too less. Hats Off!<br><br>And finally,<br><br>Mr. Mukesh Kumar — The Head of Exun. Period.<br><br>I am hoping nobody has been left out. Once Again, Thank you for making Exun such a big success. I truly feel it has been the “Golden Year of Exun”<br><br>Cheerio<br>Dhruv &amp; Gursartaj<br>Presidents<br>Exunclan</p></div></div></section>
