Doing the honors was Bertrand Serlet, who took the stage by saying “what a sharp contrast with Vista our OS is,” and only got rolling from there, pointing out “what a big hole Microsoft has dug,” and adding that “they’re trying to get out of it with Windows 7.” Of course, Serlet didn’t have many good things to say about Windows 7 either, which he says has “even more complexity” than Vista because it’s just based on the “same old tech as Vista.”</p><p name="9991" id="9991" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are some of the disgusting,shocking tactics Apple stooped to this WWDC, bashing a product that has been hailed by the entire tech community. I remember Jobs in the 1997 Boston Macworld. I remember him saying “We have to let go off the notion that for Apple to win Microsoft has to lose. We must understand that for Apple to win, We have to perform better.”</p><p name="db2d" id="db2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I clearly dont see the same company before my eyes today. Throwing away my iPod and Time Capsule. Not using it until Apple comes up with a public apology.</p><p name="cc82" id="cc82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Web Response</p><p name="b375" id="b375" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Seems like Apple are scared about Windows 7”</p><p name="0685" id="0685" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Apple is scared, and they should be, because Windows 7 is better that anything they could hope to make. Can’t beat it? Bash it. …Pathetic.”</p><p name="562d" id="562d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“At least Windows 7 is not called Windows Snow Vista.”</p><p name="a274" id="a274" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’s more telling is that in their own keynote, Apple still feels it necessary to try to belittle the competition, not by outdoing them, but by making snide remarks about how bad that competition is. I’d much rather hear them talk about how they’re improving their products to overcome the competition, rather than them talk about how much of misguided tech-snobs they are.”</p><p name="7f19" id="7f19" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That’s pretty tasteless, I’ve got to say.”</p><p name="3bef" id="3bef" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Windows 7 is just the same old Windows Vista!
