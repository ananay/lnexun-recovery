Considering it was Facebook, I had spare time and decided to redesign the logo, thinking of it as a quick job. One hour and a couple of glasses of coke in, and mercilessly pulling my own hair, I had nothing to show for it on my screen. This seemingly small incident surprised me more than it upset me.

We are so used to the current logos that anything else feels…unnatural. Another technical hurdle is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">limited scope</strong>: We have to adhere to a set scheme of colours, fonts, and proportions at all times. This is opposite to what we experience designing from scratch, simply a white canvas and innumerable possibilities. Leaving aside the science, creative personnel encounter a barrier unrelated to the physical work, namely the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">adoption of a philosophical outlook</strong>. If we aim to redesign an already aesthetically pleasing logo, we need good reason. This reason, more often than not, is in form of a philosophical one, a change which lets the logo connect better with the target audience. For example,</p><div name="3699" id="3699" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/the-new-google-logo-rounded-off-45db0524b46f" data-href="https://artplusmarketing.com/the-new-google-logo-rounded-off-45db0524b46f" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://artplusmarketing.com/the-new-google-logo-rounded-off-45db0524b46f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The new Google logo : Rounded off</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Edit description</em>artplusmarketing.com</a><a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/the-new-google-logo-rounded-off-45db0524b46f" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="cedf2839de5646ee9e1fcf02adcb2914" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*PgEhHgtr326Yd_kZPPaESw.gif" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*PgEhHgtr326Yd_kZPPaESw.gif);"></a></div><p name="0fe2" id="0fe2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">-Gyan Lakhwani</p><p name="22f1" id="22f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Image of the Rounded off and the Original Logo and the reason behind the change)</p><p name="830c" id="830c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luckily, the perquisites outweigh the challenges. Most importantly, the process <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">pulls us out of the conventional designing process</strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">makes us learn </strong>more than we ever can. It leads to more<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> creativity</strong>, and compels us to do more than recycle designs from the internet. Rebranding is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">chance to change</strong> with the need to, and gain a necessary sense of accomplishment. Moreover, it helps us <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">experience </strong>how designing would be under limitations and regulations, which will ultimately help us succeed in our design careers. Designing is a journey that helps us change and learn, and the rebranding process is a process through which our community grows.</p><p name="affc" id="affc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For instance, this redesign of gaana.com’s logo uses a font which is beautifully geometric and has a forwardness appearance. The italicized font style also indicates motion in music. The more circular <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">g</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a</em> symbolize openness and harmony. The icon is the first thing one sees when one downloads an application, and since gaana is a hindi word, gaana.com can utilise this identity to connect with its target audience. Visually, the Hindi letter <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ga</em> resembles musical notes.</p><p name="4b21" id="4b21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Courtesy: Anand Chowdhary, tiny.cc/anandc)</p><p name="15fa" id="15fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Tanmay Bansal</p></div></div></section>
