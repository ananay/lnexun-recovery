We installed the games via the lan connection as the cd roms where disabled in Lab 6. Anyways, as registeration was accepted only via the net or by personally giving me or bharat the names, we expected only 40 students to come, but we were worng. You see, students hardly follow the insructions given to them and such can be the case seen in the break today. More than 100 students flocked in front of lab 6 and the whole basement was filled with students, none wanting to listen to anybody and maintaing any decorem, there was utter chaos. It was more of a stampede, but with the help of Mukesh Nagpal sir and a few d2 members we finnaly managed to disperse the crowd. Also the students of class ix had gone for some trip, therefore the event for them had to be postponed.After that we came up with a decent strategy. Students now were called from there sections personally by us. We even allowed the unregistered members to participate. After many rounds, the winners from classes VI, VII, VIII were finally chosen. 75 or so students participated and out of them the firsts from classes VI,VII,VIII are as follows:-<br>From VI-Dipanker VI-F<br>From VII-Shreshth VII-J<br>From VIII-Mannan VIII-A<br>This competition although had a chaotic start came out rather smooth,decent and fair. Nobody was left out and we had a good time hosting it. I would also like to apologize for the horrendous beginning but well all’s well that ends well. I would also like to thank the following people for making Domain Square 2005 a success:-<br>Mukesh sir<br>Mukesh Nagpal sir<br>Bharat<br>Abhijit<br>Rasagya<br>Gaurav Mishra<br>Mannan<br>Digvijay<br>Aviral<br>Shubhajit<br>Ananya<br>I apologize if i have missed out any names.<br><br>Thanking you<br><br>Manas Gautam<br><br>p.s. competition for class ix and x-xii will be held later.</p></div></div></section>
