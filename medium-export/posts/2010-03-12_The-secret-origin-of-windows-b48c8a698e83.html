Trower was the product manager who ultimately shipped Windows 1.0, an endeavor that some advised him was a path toward a ruined career. Four product managers had already tried and failed to ship Windows before him, and he initially thought that he was being assigned an impossible task. In this follow-up to yesterday’s story on the future of Windows, Trower recounts the inside story of his experience in transforming Windows from vaporware into a product that has left an unmistakable imprint on the world, 25 years after it was first released.</blockquote><p name="4577" id="4577" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing"><a href="http://technologizer.com/2010/03/08/the-secret-origin-of-windows/" data-href="http://technologizer.com/2010/03/08/the-secret-origin-of-windows/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://technologizer.com/2010/03/08/the-secret-origin-of-windows/</a><br><br>Great stuff<br><br>(via daringfireball.net)</p></div></div></section>
