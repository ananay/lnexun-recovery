Over the last few years, we have seen a rapid change in technology tools and services; we are moving very fast from the bulky personal computers that we were once fascinated by, to tiny palmtops, smart mobile devices, and now to wearable devices. Most services that seemed impossible are now available at a touch. The speed of data is moving from mbps to gbps and those days aren’t far when it becomes ptbs.</p><p name="8c29" id="8c29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We started working on CPU 8086/80286 with a speed in range of 6 MHz to 25 MHz and today we are on CPUs running at over 2GHz, an upgrade of about a hundred times.</p><p name="2ba0" id="2ba0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many technology companies are working on business models wherein they are not charging users directly for their services, making more and more people benefit from it. Google is one of the biggest such companies that believes in global access to technology.</p><p name="8a3d" id="8a3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With more and more use of technology tools and services, we are automatically heading towards a transparent and simplified culture, where we aren’t dependant on individuals for information and data. This eradicates corruption and the role of the middleman, which is a serious allegation against ethics in technology.</p><p name="bc19" id="bc19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of the innovative things, I would like to share as per views of some experts as follows:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="09a7" id="09a7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Mindfulness assistance devices</strong> — Mindfulness, mental stress and performance is the next biggest area of self-improvement coming to the world. As the white-collar economy and the speed of life increases, everyone will be looking for an edge both in performance and happiness. — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">James McDonough</strong>, SEE Forge</li><li name="abe8" id="abe8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Wearable solar jackets</strong> — We are becoming more and more reliant on our smartphones and when the battery dies, we are lost. There is this cool new product, wearable solar, that charges your device through solar power. Stuck somewhere with a dying phone? Slip on a jacket and head outside to power up your device. — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Elliot Bohm</strong>, Cardcash.com<br><br>3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Smart fitness monitors</strong> — Are today’s fitness monitors providing you the kind of insights you need to change your lifestyle and behavior? I don’t think so. In the coming months, these devices will become much smarter using machine learning so that they can tell you what to do and when to do it. The current state is a passive one where you know what you did, the future state is an active one where these devices are your actual health partners. This will need an innovation in both hardware and software, but more so in machine learning tailored to digital health. — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Ashu Dubey</strong>, 12 Labs</li><li name="fb9f" id="fb9f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Smart contact lenses</strong> — The next phase isn’t fitness, but health and medicine. Google in particular has been eyeing contact lenses as a way to monitor glucose levels — a $10 billionmarket. — Sam Saxton, Salter Spiral Stair and Mylen Stairs<br><br>5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">High-tech fabric</strong> — The biggest opportunity in the wearable space is to embed the sensors into the fabric of clothing. Forcing someone to wear a device creates a barrier to growth. Embedding the technology into apparel will allow the most natural integration with fashion. — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Aaron Schwartz</strong>, Modify</li><li name="721d" id="721d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Happiness and emotional monitors</strong> — As our brain’s patterns and chemical fluctuations become more understood, we’ll soon be able to easily deter shifts in emotions and moods that impact our output. We often don’t pay attention to our moods during the day, and wearables could help offer insight, almost like a coach. Moods are often just simply triggered by external factors (like “road rage” when driving or an incessant employee who triggers a judgmental attitude) or physical conditions (like “hanger,” which makes you terse and crabby because you skipped lunch). — <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Beck Bamberger</strong>, BAM Communications<br><br>And many more such innovations are in the pipeline. What is important for us now is not to panic, but to watch and watch, and choose what we need to adopt according to our own needs. With such innovations, we get more FREEDOM to choose the right thing in right manner.</li></ol><figure name="4282" id="4282" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*KJXbCk5I38ZSv4Wo.jpg" data-width="249" data-height="300" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MukeshKumar-249x300.jpg" alt="mukeshkumar" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KJXbCk5I38ZSv4Wo.jpg"></figure><p name="915c" id="915c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Mukesh Kumar</p></div></div></section>
