At this point I resist the urge to use some phrases that most of you are familiar with…a decade of excellence, 10 years of expertise and so on. Its has been all that and more…<br>In the weeks preceding Exun, we saw a lot of hard work and a lot of heart being put into the making of Exun.<br><br>Sakshi, Aditya, Shashwat: They were like the little fairies running up and down, appearing and disappearing at the slightest buzz of the walkie talkie, guiding the way, quite literally. Their success story lies in the fact that there were no students lost and stranded looking for the venues.<br><br>Saumya, Digvijay: There was no complaining, no whining no matter what they were asked to do; whether it was to count 498 food coupons, fetch oregano or look after the gamers in lab 6…all jobs well done.<br><br>Aviral: Displayed much needed caution with the food coupons, as dominoes mania swept the campus, and rightly so. Not only that, Aviral’s multitasking abilities made him indispensable in the events of the 2 days.<br><br>Sahil: Officially, our most efficient webmaster. He refused to leave his seat from in front of the computer all throughout. Result? Lightning fast updates on exunclan.com.<br><br>Gaurav: You will probably find Gaurav missing from most of the photographs from Exun. That’s because, if there’s a camera, he has to behind the lens. From digital imaging to gaming there was not a single event that wasn’t covered.<br><br>Vansh: He’s our guy from the control room; from the intro video to quizzing scoresheets to audience entertainment, he’s done it all…also, as Access and Code Wars have shown, a talented quizzer. Keep up the brilliance!<br><br>Raman, Swati, Nikhil, Dhruv: I know that all of you were busy with endless test series and what not, but the time that you guys spent in the lab, it was fabulously utilized…with over 500 clues to proofread and envelope you guys had your hands full. Incredible!<br><br>Vibhas: For thinking big and executing your ideas (even when there were some who thought they were unrealistic), for your quest for perfection and for everything else, hats off to you!(the big red and white hat at that)!<br><br>Aditya, Sanchit: You guys worked hard, thanks for finding the glue which kept you stuck at the reg desk and thanks for keeping things together.<br><br>Mohit, Siddharth: A few days before the event, Mohit remarked — “I haven’t talked more on the phone in my whole life than I have in the past few weeks”. Well, it’s harder to be more precise than that. They were born for the PR stuff.<br><br>Rasagy: We have in Rasagy, another very devoted member willing to help out with any work no matter how big or small. Thank you for being around to make sure that everything went off nice and smooth.<br><br>Akul, Anant, Abhijit, Manas, Bharat: From invigilation duties, to controlling the hungry crowds, to climbing the school walls to put up banners, these guys have been there, done that…and more…The class of 2008, amazing work! Every one of you had a big part to play and will have bigger parts to play next year.<br><br>Udit, Rijul: Nice work with the judge care…its hard to match up to the expectations of the Exun alumni but they were a happy lot as they didn’t go hungry (well, mostly).<br><br>Varun: One of the riskiest things about being incharge of disaster management is the possibiliity of being blamed for everything that goes wrong and the best sort of disaster management is when everyone thinks you did nothing, when effectively you’ve looked into everything that needed looking into. So thanks for nothing and thanks for everything!<br><br>Gudi, Dhruv: Need I elaborate?<br><br>A BIIIIG thank you to all the teachers who helped make Exun a success!<br><br>Suji ma’am, Anita ma’am, Sangeeta ma’am: Thank you for helping us out with the speeches, putting up with our last minute rehearsals, and looking into the little things that escaped our notice. Basically, thank you for making Exun whole.<br><br>Romi ma’am, Thomas sir: For such an amazing job with the certificates and a level of efficiency that is truly rare, thank you so much.<br><br>Anup Sir: For making FindeX possible. 2 days before Exun, our FindeX software was full of bugs…. and then there were none. Thank you sir.<br><br>Joseph sir: For spending countless hours in guiding our brilliant team in the making of the video. The video has definitely been one of the highlights this year.<br><br>Shankar sir: Efficiency unlimited. What can I say? Shankar sir is by far one of the most resourceful and reliable people that I or anybody has met. Whether it’s a network problem that needs to be fixed or you run short of pens or photocopies or blank CDs, its just amazing how he has a solution to everything. Sir, you’re our superhero!<br><br>Rajesh Sir: For such a grand introduction to the Exun video..that was mind blowing!<br><br>We also thank Mohit sir, Priya ma’am, Aurbindo sir, Ajit sir, Vijay sir and Tiwari sir for helping us coordinate Exun 2005, for correcting us where we were wrong and for supervising the work of an enthusiastic team.<br><br>And at the very heart of the ExunClan there is one individual who is the driving force in all our endeavors and in the spirit that makes us Exun. Among many other firsts, this year saw Mukesh sir conduct the final round of the crossword for the first time…and with astounding success, I say! One of the very Exunnish things about your presence is that it always seems to make the ceiling disappear, it gives us this boundless freedom to explore our talents and makes any daunting task look possible. Thank you for supporting us in the choices and decisions that we’ve made, for guiding and believing in each and every one of us.<br><br>Cheers everyone!<br><br>-Ishita &amp; Abhisheyk</p></div></div></section>
