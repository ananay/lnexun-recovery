Photoshop has been around for 15 years now and the new features that CS2 offers are still more surprising to see.<br>The vastness and complexity of the software is undefined(there are at least 95 Photoshop how-to books, three Photoshop magazines and four annual Photoshop conferences — no wonder you don’t get a Photoshop how to do book with the software!!).<br><br>Most of the improvements are administrative rather than creative. To reduce complications with the staggering 494 menu commands that Photoshop has to offer it is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Edit menus</strong> dialogue box which comes to the rescue where you can hide commands you never use and highlight those used most often.<br><br>It also comes with bridge, a new graphics browsing program which resembles IPhoto from apple. It looks like a slide sorter which displays all images on your HD as thumbnails, you can sort them , crop, rotate ,give star ratings to them and much more. More importantly bridge also applies certain transformations to sets of images all at once without interrupting work on Photoshop. It can also convert file formats for various formats of images in a few clicks.<br><br>Bridge also connects to Adobe’s online photo service where you can buy professional photos from services such as Comstock and Getty images but each photo costs no less than 200$!!<br><br>Some common features include everyday tools such as a new feature using which you can quickly remove red eye. The spot healing brush is one more feature which can remove something from a white hair to an entire body. The Wrap mode enables you to bend or twist an image as a whole into any shape.<br><br>with all these new features and more the new Photoshop is definitely the ultimate software for image-editing.</p></div></div></section>
