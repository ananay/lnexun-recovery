This is for those who didinot attend the senior assembly today. It was real fun. Of course i am going to talk about the best part only… The interview of teachers of computer department- Mr Mukesh Kumar, Ms Hema Jain and Mr Mohitendra Dey. I must say that the questions were really well framed.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="27e6" id="27e6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Q1 (To Mr Mukesh): Why do you think that there are so few male teachers in our school?<br><br><br><br>The reply: That is a very tough question to answer….[really long pause]…that is really a difficult question. ……..[pause]Please ask me some other question [quietly]. [Mrs. Chona prompts from back stage!!] Maybe male teachers do not join this proffession because women <br><br>are the better half.</li><li name="7e64" id="7e64" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q2 (To Ms Hema Jain): What has been the most rewarding moment of your teaching career?<br><br><br><br>The reply:I think… when students pass out of school [she is probably relieved], and they come back when they’re well-settled and invite us for their marriages, i guess that’s when I really feel good about being a teacher.</li><li name="79c0" id="79c0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q3 (To Mr Mohit Dey): What character from TV serials do you relate yourself to?<br><br><br><br>The reply:The only serials i watch on TV…mostly what I watch on TV is cartoon network. You probably won’t believe it but that is how it is. A character on TV I relate with…. that would be… my favourite character is mickey mouse. [crowd laughs!!] Yes! Mickey Mouse and Tintin, maybe.</li></ul><p name="64c2" id="64c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">One more question whose answer was related to a computer teacher was asked to Mrs. Meenu Kanwar: If you were to compete for a beauty pageant, say Miss Chandigarh, which teacher in this school do you think will be your toughest competition?<br><br><br><br>The reply: Actually, I have been Miss Chandigarh earlier, [crowd cheers a lot!] and now if I have to compete my biggest competitor would be….[???GUESS WHO?? Obviously a computer teacher]<br><br><br><br><br><br><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Note: The replies of the questions have been recalled from memory and thus maynot be 100% accurate.</em></p></div></div></section>
