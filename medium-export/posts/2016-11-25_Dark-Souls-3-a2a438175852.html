Superb class and character design, accompanied by a plethora of sharp pointy objects to flay, fillet and decapitate with results in the optimum amount of satisfaction for the player, add stunning visuals to the already mesmerizing equation and you get the very essence of Dark Souls III.</p><p name="901c" id="901c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Kingdom of Lothric and its underlying areas offer some of the most picturesque, horrific scenery you can imagine. With steep lush hills leading straight into swamps and bogs full of *cough* unforgivingly *cough* hard enemies, caverns and churches all giving off that decidedly Dark Souls vibe. The scenery comes with it’s own array of assorted night terrors &amp; amazing boss fights from Iudex Gundyr in the beginning to the box depicted Soul of Cinder. Every fight leaves you with chills and an immense sense of self gratification.</p><p name="3336" id="3336" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows<br>Developed by: FromSoftware<br>Release date: March 24, 2016</p><p name="82ee" id="82ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The critically acclaimed Souls Series by FromSoftware, published by Bandai Namco, has received it’s latest installment, the behemoth itself Dark Souls III. With precursory titles such as Bloodborne and the original Dark Souls, it has a mighty benchmark to live up to, and we the gamers at Domain²+ are pleased to report that it truly does.</p><figure name="8866" id="8866" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*n5jtEDb67kYJodTH.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="169" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/darksouls1280jpg-98f75c_1280w-300x169.jpg" alt="darksouls1280jpg-98f75c_1280w" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*n5jtEDb67kYJodTH.jpg"></figure><p name="6c35" id="6c35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The original Dark Souls, elegantly presented a world which was drifting slowly but surely towards the forthcoming apocalypse, Dark Souls III violently plunges you into a chaotic,neurotic world which gets your adrenaline pumping from minute 1.

Every fight leaves you with chills and an immense sense of self gratification.</p><p name="a8cf" id="a8cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dark Souls follows the lineage by having tremendously hard enemies which will smother, crush, stomp, jerk &amp; rip your character into shreds if you even give them a pinky finger’s worth of leeway. This is where the aforementioned ‘sharp pointy objects’ come into play, an arsenal of maces, clubs, katanas, swords, great-swords, axes and so much more at your disposal for the soul (punz) purpose of digging into the enemies and digging out of your premade grave, all in one piece.</p><p name="dd3a" id="dd3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The mechanics are polished, with every roll, duck and parry seeming lifelike, every move you make plays a crucial survivability role. Fast, agile &amp; hard hitting enemies and even faster and more hard hitting Bosses results in a game that always keeps you on your toes. Like earlier games this installment also features the popularly known save mechanic of bonfires which ties into the lore of Dark Souls very well. Bosses like the Nameless King and his Wyvern Steed result in you attaining what can only be described as a higher state of consciousness while fighting them. After players have gone through the PvE content there is also optional ‘Invasion’ PvP content which allows players to drop into other users games and fight them for loot and riches.</p><p name="8398" id="8398" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Score: 9.3/10</p><p name="b574" id="b574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Reviewed by: Anubhav Ghosh</p></div></div></section>
