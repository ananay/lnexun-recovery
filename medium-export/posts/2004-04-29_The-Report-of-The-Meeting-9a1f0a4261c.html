Most of the members showed up. This log was discussed and the URL was given to all members, and if anyone’s smart enough to log on to <a href="http://www.exunclan.com," data-href="http://www.exunclan.com," class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.exunclan.com,</a> they’ll be able to make their way here.<br><br><br><br>So, anyway, this site serves the following purposes:<br><br>- Serve the Exun members with news about upcoming events and competitions (including intra-school events and meetings)<br><br>- It’s a place where we will post Quizzing, Programming questions so that Exun members can hone their skills. <br><br>- Submit Reports like this one for the Exun community (and basically anyone else who cares to read)<br><br>- A place where any Exun member can post an entry and be heard by everyone else. Comments help to communicate between authors and readers.<br><br><br><br>Apart from that, we announced that each Class (from VIII to XII probably) would be having a Domain Square representative who would be incharge of advertising and promotion for that class. This will help us make Exun kind-of object-oriented and easier to handle, especially in these gaming events in which the participation is large. By object-oriented, I mean to say that each person at his/her level gets his/her duties done and then reports to his/her superior. Just that. The superior shouldn’t have to know what the person is doing or how he’s doing it.<br><br><br><br>Maanick Nangia discussed his Project Billboard which should see growth over the next few months. <br><br><br><br>Exun made a call for new talent for the group, people who are not only skilled at what they do, but more important, sincere, assiduous and interested.<br><br><br><br>Oh yes, quite an important thing was that member photos got taken and the member list got updated, which shall be reflected on the website soon.<br><br><br><br>Mukesh Sir stressed the importance of the fact that Exun members need to keep interacting with each other, not only for the sake of it, but also in that it gives meaning to the fraternité and everyone learns something or another from someone else.<br><br><br><br>Every Exun member shall be delegated tasks and given deadlines. These tasks and deadlines will be posted on ln(exun).<br><br><br><br>That’s all folks<br><br> — Karan<br><br>President, I say</p></div></div></section>
