He died yesterday (25th July). <br><br> He gave a famous lecture on what he would like to tell the generation of today if he was to give a last lecture (ironically- as he suffered from a terminal disease). This “Last Lecture” was a series of lectures by many notable people which also included Randy Pausch.<br><br><br> From wikipedia</p><p name="012d" id="012d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Quote:</strong></p><p name="b09a" id="b09a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pausch delivered his “Last Lecture,” titled “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” at CMU on September 18, 2007.This talk was modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical “final talk,” i.e., “what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if you knew it was your last chance?”<br><br>Before speaking, Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students. When he motioned them to sit down, saying, “Make me earn it,” some in the audience shouted back, “You did!”</p><p name="3cc8" id="3cc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is the video of that speech. <br><br>“Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams”</p><figure name="08f8" id="08f8" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ji5_MqicxSo?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="e57d" id="e57d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">(The video is 76min long)<br><br>I think everyone should see it.
