Bloodfist has finally been added to one of the busiest clans in our school… lemme give him a briefing … Exun has now taken the lead in printing documents, producing perfect jackasses and all other sorts of useless stuff. Nevertheless Exun has been appreciated before . I recently met an alumni of our school who was a commercie. She was the Spokeperson of Exun.. Helped in organizing Exun events once or twice… She had only 1 thing to say : “I had never seen such loyalty of the members in a DPS club.. One comment against the club and all Juniors were ready to Murder you”<br><br><br><br>That was Exun of 1998. Its 2004 now but Exun has actually deteriorated. We have some of the biggest loonies of our school in Exun now. Exun now entering officialdom is now gonna go down even further. Next year is a ‘Big Worry’. We have no suitable successor to presidentship (even this year, one of the presidents is a perfect jackass.No prizes for guessing who it is). What shudders me more is that in 2007 Exun will go into the Hands of (Gulp!!) Gursartaj and Gang.. Then i think the club will be fit for dissolution. Exun scaled many heights but now signs of wear and tear are showing. We need a Fresh Approach .. A new Beginning.. We need to do something or else we might go the Intercrap Club Way<br><br><br><br>Thanks for Listening to my crap which is nevertheless important</p></div></div></section>
