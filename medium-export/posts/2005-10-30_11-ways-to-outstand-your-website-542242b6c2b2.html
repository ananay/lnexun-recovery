But this is the most fundamental of all in the long run of good webdesigning…<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1. Consistency</strong><br><br>Colour schemes, page layout, font type &amp; size should all be consistent throughout your site. Indeed if you have an established corporate image (colours &amp; logos) this can provide the basis of your site to improve company or brand recognition. Graphical icons used should persist on all pages to improve navigation and recognition.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Conciseness</strong><br>Unlike traditional paper-based media more space does not mean more cost. Some sites cram too much information on each page causing problems to your visitor in recognising the section they are looking for. Generally people read up to 25% slower from PC screens therefore too much information on each page will give rise to ‘visitor fatigue.’ Descriptions should be brief with links to greater detail if viewers want it. Whitespace can be used effectively to space content across a page for ease of reading.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. Easy Navigation</strong><br>Navigation should have a natural logic. There should be no dead-ends and viewers should not need to use their own Back button. Navigation bars should be comprehensive and have a consistent theme. They should be placed in the same place on each page, normally in the margin or across the top.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4. Update Your Site Often</strong><br>People expect the Internet to hold up-to-date information. Unlike other mediums your web-site should never be out-of-date. Even subtle changes to page layout and graphics on a regular basis can give the impression of ‘freshness’ even if the content has not changed.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5. Consider Download Times</strong><br>Too many sites include wonderful graphics, video sequences and other animations which are eye-catching but take forever to download. If a page has not fully loaded after 8 seconds the chances are your visitor (and potential customer) will move on to another site — probably your competitors! Graphics should be simple and consistent whilst multimedia and other features that require special plug-ins should be kept to a minimum.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">6. Make Information Accessible</strong><br>There is nothing more disheartening to your visitor than being confident your site has the answer to his or her question but being unable to find it. Viewers must be able to gather information easily and quickly, this will encourage return visits.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">7. Avoid Long User-Input Forms</strong><br>Having to answer a long list of questions is a sure way to lose a visitor’s interest. Many people are reluctant to give lots of personal information. Questions should be kept to a minimum.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">8. Use Contact Us Links</strong><br>Viewers enjoy the interactivity of the Internet. They should be given the opportunity to ask questions or request more information. It is imperative though that all requests and questions are actioned as soon as possible.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">9. Check Detail</strong><br>Spelling errors, poor grammar, poor page layout all add up to an inferior presentation. The smallest detail can give rise to a poor image of your business. Sites should be cleared of outdated information and checked for compatibility across a number of browsers.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">10. Site Under Construction</strong><br>This is a definite No! If your site is not ready do not launch it. Viewers will not re-visit it to see when it is up and running. They will go to your competitors site.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">11. Quality Content</strong><br>I(Dhruv) believe that content has greater importance than any other parameter in developing websites. Unless you have good content, users have no reason to visit your website.And unless you have good content, people will certainly not come back to your website.Never underestimate the importance of high quality and orignal content.<br>…This is suggested by Dhruv<br><br>So to say, I am giving my website a drastic makeover — i.e Exploreuniverse.com will be the most updated website of all Universe,Astronomy and space related websites.Presently I get around 30,000 hits a day(10,000 unique visits) and 100s of emails for putting ads and links of other website on my site.If any of my friends want his or her blog or site listed on my site feel free to contact me.</p></div></div></section>
