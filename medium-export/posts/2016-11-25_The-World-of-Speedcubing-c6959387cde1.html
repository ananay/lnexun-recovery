Though basic in concept, it has baffled people of all ages across the world for decades. It is incredibly simple, yet surprisingly complex — a paradox in the real sense!</p><p name="ae15" id="ae15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since its creation by Hungarian mathematician Ernố Rubik, people have spent countless hours trying to come up with viable methods for solving it that didn’t rely on luck. After all, with its 43 quintillion (a billion raised to the power 3 multiplied by a thousand) possible permutations, it’s pretty hard to get lucky. These methods became widely known due to their simplicity and efficiency. Some of these are — CFOP, Roux, Petrus, ZZ, Heise and their variants. Several people have been able to solve the Rubik’s cube using these methods and consequently, solving the Rubik’s cube now has become a competitive sport. This new activity was named “Speedcubing”, which refers to solving the cube in as little time as possible.</p><figure name="1db6" id="1db6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*yafxxnWJQfSqroJt.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="300" data-external-src="http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cube-300x300.jpg" alt="cube" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yafxxnWJQfSqroJt.jpg"></figure><p name="2851" id="2851" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">One question which may immediately come to mind is whether solving the cube makes you smarter. Well, it won’t help help you pass exams, but it’ll keep your brain active in terms of cognitive skills. You’ll inevitably develop a wider perception of problem solving. As for motor skills, cubing goes a long way in improving hand-eye coordination and concentration in general. Among the eight different types of intelligence that humans are presumed to have according to Howard Gardner, spatial or visual intelligence is the foremost — the ability to mentally recreate the real world. Given its three-dimensional nature, the cube can help in improving spatial intelligence.</p><p name="8389" id="8389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The world of speed cubing</strong></p><p name="256f" id="256f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Rubik’s cube is a popular source of entertainment.

The popularity of this sport is continually growing given the many benefits as well as the competitive nature of the events conducted by WCA. Also, several manufacturers (including Rubik’s) released variants of the Rubik’s cube (such as the 2x2, 4x4, 5x5 and Pyraminx).</p><p name="ec22" id="ec22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, one must realise that speedcubing isn’t just about going to competitions and trying to win — It’s about meeting new people, sharing experience, and having a great time. The true spirit of speedcubing is in constantly striving to improve, and ultimately reaching your goal.</p><p name="def6" id="def6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">-Kunal Oak(11-F)</p></div></div></section>
