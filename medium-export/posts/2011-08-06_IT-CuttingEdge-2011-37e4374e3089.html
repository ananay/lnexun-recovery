The fest consisted of three on-site events: the Junior Quiz, the Senior Quiz and Inst@nt dZine (a website and graphic designing event), as well as an online event, DeCryptonite. The online event ran for a full month, from 5th July to 1st August, and entailed a cryptic treasure hunt where students had to make their way through more than 30 online levels of increasing difficulty. DeCryptonite received a tremendous response from DPS schools across the country. Although the event started off with about 500 participants, the numbers soon began running into thousands, with over 6000 registrations being received from 62 DPS schools. The hunt was applauded by all, and ended with a total active participation of 3551.</p><p name="c25e" id="c25e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the on-site phase of the festival, 25 schools with over 140 participants exhibited their expertise in the field of IT and digital design in the three events. All three events saw extremely close competition, with teams trying their best to come out on top. DPS RK Puram, being the host school, remained non-competitive. The students and teachers of the school were a part of the organisation and judging of the event.</p><p name="2516" id="2516" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Closing Ceremony was graced by the presence of Shri Ashok Chandra, Chairman DPS Society, Mrs. Renu Mittal, Director DPS Society, and Dr. D.R. Saini, Principal of DPS RK Puram. Dr. Saini expressed his thanks to the DPS Society for encouraging the festival, and spoke to the students about the importance of using technology appropriately.</p><p name="f813" id="f813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mrs. Renu Mittal too addressed the gathering, highlighting the need to show the sportsman spirit in competition and appreciating the efforts put into organising the fest.</p><p name="f7a9" id="f7a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The final round of the Senior Quiz was held in the presence of the distinguished guests, allowing them to glimpse the cutthroat competition that prevailed.</p><p name="8383" id="8383" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prior to the award distribution, Shri Ashok Chandra shared his thoughts with the students, commending the effort put in by DPS RK Puram and the exceptionally high standard of the event and expressing his confidence and pride in the participants. He spoke about the importance of technology in modern education and the need to be followed rather than follow, leaving the students with his inspiring thoughts on constantly being innovative and striving for excellence.</p><p name="459b" id="459b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The entire IT festival was a true example of human networking and technological growth.</p><h4 name="a9fa" id="a9fa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Closing Video</h4><figure name="9669" id="9669" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--h4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmb1knJde80?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h4 name="1294" id="1294" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Photo Album</h4><p name="8002" id="8002" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">[gallery link=”file”]</p></div></div></section>
