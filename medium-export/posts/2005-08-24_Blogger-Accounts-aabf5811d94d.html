However, I have to disappoint those Prospective Bloggers by informing them that, since I have graduated from the grey walls of the school back in April, I no longer have the authority to do what they want of me. So, let me make this declaration that I am not to be contacted for Blogger Invitations. For that purpose, you must either contact the two Presidents of the Clan of Exun, the Senior Coordinations of the Clan of Exun, or the Head of the Clan of Exun, who are, in that order, Abhisheyk &amp; Ishita, Gursartaj &amp; Dhruv, or Mr. Mukesh Kumar.<br><br>Of late, I have also heard one more curious piece of information from certain members. The dialogue is as follows: “Now that we’re in ninth, can we post on ln(exun), please?” I have removed subsequent question marks from the end of the sentence for clarity; however, the message is quite clear. While founding this blue-headered website, I had no intention of limiting posting to members of certain classes only. While I cannot say if the rules have changed, if they have not, I request that, in the same manner as Exun Member Photographs, all those who have not been made members of this website be rounded up and sent Invitations by the Proper Authority and Channel, hopefully regardless of age, sex, creed, caste, colour, strength of character and intelligence.<br><br>Always at your service,<br> — Karan<br>Ex-President of the Clan of Ex-un<br><br>PS1: As a request to the side, I would also like to be stop being pelted with requests for Words of Pass. I have none.<br>PS2: I do not know if this entry complies with the Strict Regulations of Postable Content. If it does not, then I apologise profusely and invite an Administrator to nullify the entry.<br>PS3: Try “Look What You’ve Done” by Jet.</p></div></div></section>
