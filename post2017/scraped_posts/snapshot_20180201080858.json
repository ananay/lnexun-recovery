Developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games, the third installment in the Mafia franchise typically focuses on a huge open world environment . Unlike the previous games in the series, it focuses on the aspects of revenge and vengeance, building our own gang and going against the mafia &nbsp;and burning them to the ground with military-grade weaponry. It is available on PS4, XBOX ONE and PC. Winner of the NAVGTR award for the best video and dramatic score, this game is surely a good pick for action loving gamers.</span></p>\n<p><strong>PLOT</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mafia 3 is set in 1968, New Bordeaux, Louisiana which is also the hometown of our hero, the protagonist Lincoln Clay; with military training and combat experience in Vietnam, Lincoln is the tough guy you can rely on for anything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After serving in the Vietnam War in the 5th Special Forces and 223rd infantry regiment , Lincoln Clay comes back to his surrogate family i.e. the black mob led by Sammy Robimson and his adopted brother Ellis. They team up with the italian mafia led by Don Marcano to loot the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Louisiana Federal Reserve</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but after the heist they are betrayed and Lincoln is the only one who manages to survive. The story revolves around Lincoln building a new family on the ashes of the old and blazing a path of revenge on the brutal criminal underworld responsible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gameplay mostly involves driving around New Bordeaux, getting missions from various characters, reaping the &nbsp;rewards, and occasionally get sidetracked along the way. The story missions are big and are set in unique, well-designed locations. This includes fighting your way through a creepy abandoned amusement park, escaping the bank vault after a heist, and sneaking aboard a sinking riverboat by swimming through water filled with gators all provide some memorable action-packed moments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the transportation the player gets a lot of options to choose from, ranging from Exotic 60 coupes like the super cool “Griffin Marauder” to trucks like “Bulworth Buckliners” as well as boats and other military vehicles. The fastest way is to drive around the vast map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favourite mode to get around is through the sportscar &nbsp;‘Berkely Stallion’ . It is easy to maneuver, decent speed but highly durable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BUT, there are certain other issues as well. The version of the game released for the consoles has lag and a few bugs. When the intense action and battles starts, the frame rate drops below 30fps. This causes a glitch to appear and the protagonist may end up dying while engaged in combat in the middle of the mission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance the initial mission in which &nbsp;I was supposed to go and kill the leader of the Haitian mob, Baka. I was trying throw molotov cocktails but thy ended up burning me as &nbsp;I couldn’t throw them cause of the glitch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also the story missions are very repetitive as we do the same things like &nbsp;which leads to the person playing getting bored.</span></p>\n<p><strong>COMBAT</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game does justice to the action and mayhem part associated with the Mafia series.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the huge arsenal of Vintage weaponry and diving around in stunning antique vehicles you set &nbsp;New Bordeaux on fire wherever you go. The approach is yours to choose from: stealth or full-front attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game, a third-person shooter, has more of &nbsp;mid to long range gunplay.

Developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games, the third installment in the Mafia franchise typically focuses on a huge open world environment . Unlike the previous games in the series, it focuses on the aspects of revenge and vengeance, building our own gang and going against the mafia &nbsp;and burning them to the ground with military-grade weaponry. It is available on PS4, XBOX ONE and PC. Winner of the NAVGTR award for the best video and dramatic score, this game is surely a good pick for action loving gamers.</span></p>\n<p><strong>PLOT</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mafia 3 is set in 1968, New Bordeaux, Louisiana which is also the hometown of our hero, the protagonist Lincoln Clay; with military training and combat experience in Vietnam, Lincoln is the tough guy you can rely on for anything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After serving in the Vietnam War in the 5th Special Forces and 223rd infantry regiment , Lincoln Clay comes back to his surrogate family i.e. the black mob led by Sammy Robimson and his adopted brother Ellis. They team up with the italian mafia led by Don Marcano to loot the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Louisiana Federal Reserve</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but after the heist they are betrayed and Lincoln is the only one who manages to survive. The story revolves around Lincoln building a new family on the ashes of the old and blazing a path of revenge on the brutal criminal underworld responsible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gameplay mostly involves driving around New Bordeaux, getting missions from various characters, reaping the &nbsp;rewards, and occasionally get sidetracked along the way. The story missions are big and are set in unique, well-designed locations. This includes fighting your way through a creepy abandoned amusement park, escaping the bank vault after a heist, and sneaking aboard a sinking riverboat by swimming through water filled with gators all provide some memorable action-packed moments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the transportation the player gets a lot of options to choose from, ranging from Exotic 60 coupes like the super cool “Griffin Marauder” to trucks like “Bulworth Buckliners” as well as boats and other military vehicles. The fastest way is to drive around the vast map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favourite mode to get around is through the sportscar &nbsp;‘Berkely Stallion’ . It is easy to maneuver, decent speed but highly durable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BUT, there are certain other issues as well. The version of the game released for the consoles has lag and a few bugs. When the intense action and battles starts, the frame rate drops below 30fps. This causes a glitch to appear and the protagonist may end up dying while engaged in combat in the middle of the mission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance the initial mission in which &nbsp;I was supposed to go and kill the leader of the Haitian mob, Baka. I was trying throw molotov cocktails but thy ended up burning me as &nbsp;I couldn’t throw them cause of the glitch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also the story missions are very repetitive as we do the same things like &nbsp;which leads to the person playing getting bored.</span></p>\n<p><strong>COMBAT</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game does justice to the action and mayhem part associated with the Mafia series.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the huge arsenal of Vintage weaponry and diving around in stunning antique vehicles you set &nbsp;New Bordeaux on fire wherever you go. The approach is yours to choose from: stealth or full-front attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game, a third-person shooter, has more of &nbsp;mid to long range gunplay. We have missions which involve more of melee combat as well. Lincoln has his signature knife and carries a light and a heavy weapon along with grenades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game features a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cover feature</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing players to take cover behind objects to avoid enemy gunfire or detection.

      "content": "\n\t\t\t<h3><b>A Basic Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning is a field in computer science, which gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed to do so, and has widespread applications across several fields, such as diagnosis of diseases, optical character recognition, computer vision and email filtering. Many machine learning techniques are in-fact being used on a day-to-day basis for technologies like smart advertisements, friend recommendations as well as suggested search results, and we interact with them all the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning emerged from similar artificial intelligence fields like pattern recognition, and computational learning, and it heavily relies on statistics and mathematical optimizations. Many classification problems including anomaly-detection problems, can be solved using different machine learning algorithms put together. These algorithms form the backbone of the many technologies for use of artificially intelligent systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning algorithms are broadly divided into three categories that take on different approaches to help computers learn how to solve tasks on their own. These are: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Supervised Learning</b></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This approach to machine learning involves giving a set of inputs and outputs to a computer, and training it based on a dataset of ‘training examples’ we gave. Then it can be further used to predict new values when new inputs are provided to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically the dataset consists of pairs that consist of an input vector, and a corresponding output. The task of the machine is generally to determine a function such that on taking an argument of a new input vector, it should be able to output a value which has a high rate of accuracy of being the correct output.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This criterion leads to the necessity what is known as a bias-variance trade-off. A high-bias, low-variance machine learning model will overfit the data to even accommodate the outliers and the anomalies, and will not be able to adjust to the new inputs that are provided to it. Meanwhile, a high-variance, low-bias model will underfit the data, and though it will generalize itself well to different data, its accuracy will be low and not fit any data particularly well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus most algorithms provide a parameter that adjusts this bias-variance tradeoff so that the model generalizes well to other data outside the training data with higher accuracy.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Unsupervised Learning</b></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is used to infer results from unclassified data, where the data is provided in the form of unlabelled points without any output values given. Then, this data is grouped into separate categories based on different criterion such as the proximity of the data points, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notable difference between unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms is the absence of an accuracy feature to check the viability of the unsupervised model. This is useful when we need to find hidden structures in unlabelled data, and can draw inferences from it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data can in general, be grouped into clusters which are similar in some respect, and these hence create a new structure for finding patterns within the data. This is especially useful in data where such information or structure would have usually gone unnoticed.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Reinforced Learning</b></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an area in machine learning which is inspired by behaviourist psychology, in which the program takes actions depending on which it is either rewarded or penalized. It utilises dynamic programming techniques and is often studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, statistics as well as information theory. This approach helps the model make the ideal choices given a particular situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There exist many different solutions to such problems, however, common ones include those which will provide greater reward in the long run, as opposed to immediately after. Its applications are manifold, ranging from controlling robotic arms to programming robots to avoid obstacles by creating penalties for every obstacle hit. Logical games, such as chess, can also be programmed to be played by such models.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning is a wide and varied field with plenty of potential uses that can improve not only our technology, but also our lives. In a world filled with pessimistic warnings about the potential impact of AI on our lives, it is important to remember that such models have several advantages, too, and have led to groundbreaking research in many fields, ranging to diagnosis of diseases such as cancer simply by clicking a photo to cybersecurity and financial analysis. As in any such debate, understanding how they work is often one step closer to arriving at a compromise or a solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps we can avoid Judgement Day, after all.</span></p>\n<p>Sagnik Anupam</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

It is interesting to note here that even NVIDIA (one of the largest GPU manufacturers) is interested to compete with Google with its Tesla V100 GPGPU.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9323\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc-300x169.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc-768x432.png 768w, https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc-1024x576.png 1024w, https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc-624x351.png 624w, https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/qc.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p>\n<p>Aditya Singh</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\tThis entry was posted in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/category/uncategorized/\" rel=\"category tag\">Uncategorized</a> on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/the-future-of-computing-lies-in-the-cloud-by-aditya-singh/\" title=\"2:28 PM\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-11-21T14:28:45+00:00\">November 21, 2017</time></a><span class=\"by-author\"> by <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/author/aaraiv/\" title=\"View all posts by Aaraiv Ronaldo\" rel=\"author\">Aaraiv Ronaldo</a></span></span>.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

      "title": "The Journey of Pendrive: From flash drives to wireless stick by Kaushiv Agarwal",
      "content": "\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology changes very fast, from big computers to portable laptops; from snail-paced 2G to blazing-fast 4G. However, the most drastic change was in terms of storage of data: The Invention of the USB Drive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USB flash drives were invented at M-Systems, an Israeli company, and a US patent was filed on April 5, 1999, by Amir Ban, Dov Moran, and Oron Ogdan, all M-Systems employees. The product was announced by the company in September 2000 and was first sold by IBM in 8MB capacity starting December 15, 2000. Since the December of 2000, this nifty little tool has evolved considerably.</span></p>\n<p><strong>First Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An original IBM DiskOnKey USB flash drive, providing 8 MB of storage. In 2000, Lexar introduced a Compact Flash (CF) card with a USB connection, and a companion card read/writer and USB cable that eliminated the need for a USB hub.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Second Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2003, most USB flash drives had USB 2.0 connectivity, which has 480 Mbit/s as the transfer rate upper bound; after accounting for the protocol overhead that translates to a 35 MB/s effective throughput.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Third Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like USB 2.0 before it, USB 3.0 dramatically improved data transfer rates compared to its predecessor. It was announced in late 2008, but consumer devices were not available until the beginning of 2010. The USB 3.0 interface specifies transfer rates up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), compared to USB 2.0’s 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Fourth Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturers have announced USB 3.1 type-C flash drives with read/write speeds of around 530 MB/s. An example of this generation would be the SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick, a flash drive reinvented to work not just with your computer, but also with your phone and tablet. With the SanDisk Connect Stick in your pocket, bag, or across the room, you can wirelessly access your media, transfer large files, stream HD videos and music, and save and share media from your mobile device. Delivering up to 256GB of extra capacity, the SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick empowers your mobile lifestyle , whether you’re running a sales meeting or taking a hike in the woods. SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick lets you stream videos or music to as many as three other devices at the same time and gives you access to all of your things from your pocket. When you’re feeling old school, use the USB connector to plug in. </span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

However, the most drastic change was in terms of storage of data: The Invention of the USB Drive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USB flash drives were invented at M-Systems, an Israeli company, and a US patent was filed on April 5, 1999, by Amir Ban, Dov Moran, and Oron Ogdan, all M-Systems employees. The product was announced by the company in September 2000 and was first sold by IBM in 8MB capacity starting December 15, 2000. Since the December of 2000, this nifty little tool has evolved considerably.</span></p>\n<p><strong>First Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An original IBM DiskOnKey USB flash drive, providing 8 MB of storage. In 2000, Lexar introduced a Compact Flash (CF) card with a USB connection, and a companion card read/writer and USB cable that eliminated the need for a USB hub.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Second Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2003, most USB flash drives had USB 2.0 connectivity, which has 480 Mbit/s as the transfer rate upper bound; after accounting for the protocol overhead that translates to a 35 MB/s effective throughput.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Third Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like USB 2.0 before it, USB 3.0 dramatically improved data transfer rates compared to its predecessor. It was announced in late 2008, but consumer devices were not available until the beginning of 2010. The USB 3.0 interface specifies transfer rates up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), compared to USB 2.0’s 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Fourth Generation:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturers have announced USB 3.1 type-C flash drives with read/write speeds of around 530 MB/s. An example of this generation would be the SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick, a flash drive reinvented to work not just with your computer, but also with your phone and tablet. With the SanDisk Connect Stick in your pocket, bag, or across the room, you can wirelessly access your media, transfer large files, stream HD videos and music, and save and share media from your mobile device. Delivering up to 256GB of extra capacity, the SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick empowers your mobile lifestyle , whether you’re running a sales meeting or taking a hike in the woods. SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick lets you stream videos or music to as many as three other devices at the same time and gives you access to all of your things from your pocket. When you’re feeling old school, use the USB connector to plug in. </span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\tThis entry was posted in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/category/uncategorized/\" rel=\"category tag\">Uncategorized</a> on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/the-journey-of-pendrive-from-flash-drives-to-wireless-stick/\" title=\"2:26 PM\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-11-21T14:26:03+00:00\">November 21, 2017</time></a><span class=\"by-author\"> by <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/author/aaraiv/\" title=\"View all posts by Aaraiv Ronaldo\" rel=\"author\">Aaraiv Ronaldo</a></span></span>.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

Their chemistry works well with Chloe’s charming personality and Nadine’s tough attitude making the story solid.</span></p>\n<p><b>PLOT</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story is based in India, with the two protagonists finding the legendary tusk of Ganesh, son of the Hindu god Shiva.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as with every Uncharted game, another party is also competing to find the treasure, this time it is a ruthless warmonger, Asav. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chloe and Nadine compete with Asav and his large army in order to obtain the ancient artifact. There are many close-calls and plot twists &nbsp;which make the plot energetic.</span></p>\n<p><b>GAMEPLAY</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the subtle single-player story you control Chloe while Nadine is AI-controlled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nice addition this time is that if you ever get stuck in a puzzle, Nadine completes it for you. This helps in maintaining the fast paced flow of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In combat, players can use long-ranged weapons such as snipers, and short-barreled guns such as pistols and revolvers. Handheld explosives such as grenades and C4 are also available. Though players can attack enemies directly, they have the option to use stealth tactics to attack undetected or sneak by them. The game also introduces silenced weapons and lock-picking, a new addition using which players can obtain ammo and side-treasures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from these additions, the Lost Legacy still includes the familiar adventures of climbing the mountain along with the loop of exploration, platforming, shooting, and puzzle solving that has become the core to the gameplay experience of the franchise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the multiplayer side, The Lost Legacy also has the familiar Third-Person-Shooter with a wide array of weapons and power-ups. It is good for playing a quick match or two, but gets boring and repetitive over a period of time. The survival mode is offered offline and online, providing a challenging way to sharpen your shooting skills.</span></p>\n<p><b>GRAPHICS</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graphics speak for themselves; Naughty Dog has been the master of squeezing every last bit out of the PlayStation system.

I mean, like 90% of the tech that you get is “Made In China”, even the ubiquitous iPhone: “Designed in California, Made In Taiwan”. Not just tech, but even food! Did you know that although KFC originated in the U.S., it’s now the largest restaurant chain in China? Now, on KFC’s 30 year anniversary, it’s partnered with Huawei, one of China’s biggest smartphone producers, to release a KFC phone.</p>\n<p id=\"44d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You read that right.</p>\n<p id=\"f073\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Granted, a KFC special phone manufactured by the same guys who make the perfectly reasonable&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Honor&nbsp;</em>line of devices wasn’t exactly the product the world was pining for, but doesn’t it warm your heart to be living in an era of gratuitous marvels of technology such as this?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fwFEh8KG9eW20IPO.\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">First Ever Fried Chicken Phone! [I&nbsp;think]</p>\n<p id=\"aac6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It’s a special edition version of the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus. It has a 5.5-inch 720p display, a Snapdragon 435 SoC, a 12MP camera, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage that can be expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card. There’s a fingerprint scanner on the back and, with a 3,020MAh battery, it should last a while on a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"df1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s admittedly not a bad phone for the price (162 USD, or about Rs.10,000), although the contending Redmi Note 4 does pop into mind as a rival device by a fellow Chinese manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"96ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But come on, let’s get real. We all know you’re not buying this thing for the specs. Doing so would be like buying Air Jordans to go for a run. No, you’re buying this baby for the&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">prestige&nbsp;</em>afforded by being the owner of a limited edition phone (Huawei says they’re only make 5,000) with Col. Sanders on the back.</p>\n<p id=\"2906\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">“Kentucky China 30 years from 1987 to 2017, 30 years accompanied by the taste of the times, suck refers to the aftertaste!

Limited to 5000 will soon be on sale, waiting for you to grab!”</em></p>\n<p id=\"f560\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A cursory examination of the the quoted text (which is a victim of some unfortunate translation) reveals the phone is the whole package, coming with ten thousand K-Dollars (the restaurant’s digital currency) and the ability to share songs from a playlist when on the premises of a KFC, which basically means they’re simultaneously re-inventing the jukebox. Such innovation is rarely seen outside keynote events, so take note.</p>\n<p id=\"b6b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you’re dead set on getting mileage out of the phone, though, you’d ideally be Chinese, as the bands the phone uses may not work worldwide and the version of Android 7.0 comes without Google built into it, as it’s meant for the Chinese market.</p>\n<p id=\"697d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Better reach into the bucket of cash and pull out some dollars, cause this phone be finger-licking good.</p>\n<p>Ishir Bhardwaj</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Now, on KFC’s 30 year anniversary, it’s partnered with Huawei, one of China’s biggest smartphone producers, to release a KFC phone.</p>\n<p id=\"44d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You read that right.</p>\n<p id=\"f073\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Granted, a KFC special phone manufactured by the same guys who make the perfectly reasonable&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Honor&nbsp;</em>line of devices wasn’t exactly the product the world was pining for, but doesn’t it warm your heart to be living in an era of gratuitous marvels of technology such as this?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858im_/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fwFEh8KG9eW20IPO.\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">First Ever Fried Chicken Phone! [I&nbsp;think]</p>\n<p id=\"aac6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It’s a special edition version of the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus. It has a 5.5-inch 720p display, a Snapdragon 435 SoC, a 12MP camera, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage that can be expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card. There’s a fingerprint scanner on the back and, with a 3,020MAh battery, it should last a while on a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"df1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s admittedly not a bad phone for the price (162 USD, or about Rs.10,000), although the contending Redmi Note 4 does pop into mind as a rival device by a fellow Chinese manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"96ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But come on, let’s get real. We all know you’re not buying this thing for the specs. Doing so would be like buying Air Jordans to go for a run. No, you’re buying this baby for the&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">prestige&nbsp;</em>afforded by being the owner of a limited edition phone (Huawei says they’re only make 5,000) with Col. Sanders on the back.</p>\n<p id=\"2906\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">“Kentucky China 30 years from 1987 to 2017, 30 years accompanied by the taste of the times, suck refers to the aftertaste! Kentucky together with Huawei joint cooperation, the introduction of Huawei Chang enjoy 7 Kentucky commemorative version of gorgeous struck! Commemorative Edition laser back carving, pre-installed Kentucky Super APP, with WOW member 10 thousand K gold, but also the first to experience k-music song function. Limited to 5000 will soon be on sale, waiting for you to grab!”</em></p>\n<p id=\"f560\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A cursory examination of the the quoted text (which is a victim of some unfortunate translation) reveals the phone is the whole package, coming with ten thousand K-Dollars (the restaurant’s digital currency) and the ability to share songs from a playlist when on the premises of a KFC, which basically means they’re simultaneously re-inventing the jukebox. Such innovation is rarely seen outside keynote events, so take note.</p>\n<p id=\"b6b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you’re dead set on getting mileage out of the phone, though, you’d ideally be Chinese, as the bands the phone uses may not work worldwide and the version of Android 7.0 comes without Google built into it, as it’s meant for the Chinese market.</p>\n<p id=\"697d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Better reach into the bucket of cash and pull out some dollars, cause this phone be finger-licking good.</p>\n<p>Ishir Bhardwaj</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\tThis entry was posted in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/category/blog/\" rel=\"category tag\">Blog</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/category/blogs/\" rel=\"category tag\">blogs</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/category/uncategorized/\" rel=\"category tag\">Uncategorized</a> on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/col-sanders-new-flagship-killer-by-ishir/\" title=\"2:24 PM\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-11-21T14:24:51+00:00\">November 21, 2017</time></a><span class=\"by-author\"> by <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201080858/http://www.lnexun.com/author/aaraiv/\" title=\"View all posts by Aaraiv Ronaldo\" rel=\"author\">Aaraiv Ronaldo</a></span></span>.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",
