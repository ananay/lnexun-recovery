Keeping this in mind, we are organising a Competitive Programming Training Session to give a strong base for students of DPS RK Puram. We will definitely be looking forward to working with students who do well in these sessions. At the end of the sessions, the students will be familiar with some of the basic problem solving algorithms (binary search, greedy, and dynamic programming are some of the most popular ones) and should be fairly comfortable with implementing simple solutions. Those who practice hard may even be able to clear the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/https://www.codechef.com/ioi/zio\">Zonal Informatics Olympiad</a> (which gives students bonus points for admission in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/https://www.iiitd.ac.in/\">IIIT Delhi</a>) and, thereafter, the<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/\"> Indian National Olympiad in Informatics</a> (11th and 12th graders clearing this can get admission in IIIT Hyderabad while 12th graders can be admitted in the Chennai Mathematical Institute). Aside from these advantages, we believe that education in computer science is not truly complete until you have given problem solving your best shot. We look forward to helping you out!

Furthermore, this will enable us to extrapolate and try to predict future trends and areas that this technology would likely impact as precisely as possible. The first part of this paper will introduce the paper, clearly defining relevant terms and giving a brief history of the subject. The second part of the paper will be a discussion of how modern technology has been impacted by subliminal human interaction. Diverse areas, more so in the field of Computer Science, will be looked at. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn on whether this technology is worth pursuing or whether there are other alternatives that have benefits that outweigh those brought by subliminal technology. </span></p>\n<p>Read the complete research paper <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k18_oM1XyHefjJdpwhBXnIZwzN7NW-Fw/view\">here</a>.</p>\n\t\t",

Furthermore, this will enable us to extrapolate and try to predict future trends and areas that this technology would likely impact as precisely as possible. The first part of this paper will introduce the paper, clearly defining relevant terms and giving a brief history of the subject. The second part of the paper will be a discussion of how modern technology has been impacted by subliminal human interaction. Diverse areas, more so in the field of Computer Science, will be looked at. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn on whether this technology is worth pursuing or whether there are other alternatives that have benefits that outweigh those brought by subliminal technology. </span></p>\n<p>Read the complete research paper <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k18_oM1XyHefjJdpwhBXnIZwzN7NW-Fw/view\">here</a>.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/https://www.lnexun.com/subliminal-human-computer-communication-in-modern-technology-anirudh-chauhan/\" class=\"bttn\">Read More</a>\n\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\t</div>\n\n",

As programmers and designers are able to constantly improve video game graphics, will there ever be a point where they become equivalent to real life?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That moment has finally come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore’s Law, a computing term which originated around 1970, states that the processing power of computers doubles every two years. This directly leads to computer graphics increasing significantly over the years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does all of this matter in the game development industry? &nbsp;The best way to increase the graphical fidelity of a game is to add realistic lighting:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left with no lightning, right with a single light source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9628\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"974\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2.png 974w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2-300x85.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2-768x217.png 768w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2-213x60.png 213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\"></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left with no lightning, right with a single light source.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while adding lights in a game is relatively easy, and something we’ve been doing for decades, getting the light to bounce off, reflect, refract, and move around realistically is a much more difficult problem to solve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forefront of photorealistic graphics today is seen in the computer-generated imagery used in movies. If you’ve seen &nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War, you could reasonably argue that CGI&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is pretty much photorealistic already, and that’s because big-budget movies use a lighting technique called&nbsp;</span><b>ray tracing&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for their CGI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray tracing calculates the path of a beam of light backwards from your eye (or viewpoint) to the objects that the light interacted with. It’s what makes reflections, shadows, and refractions look extremely realistic. But here’s the catch,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray tracing is so computationally intensive that it takes days, or even weeks, to render these worlds even with many computers working together in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">render farms.”</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So you may ask the question, with the immense increase in computational power, why I do not have ray tracing? The answer sadly is, you can have it, but for 1.4 lakhs.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-9635\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5.png 443w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5-300x200.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5-90x60.png 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\"></a><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-9634\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4.png 443w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4-300x198.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4-91x60.png 91w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the launch of the RTX graphics cards, NVIDIA is bridging the gap between pre rendered and real time graphics.

As programmers and designers are able to constantly improve video game graphics, will there ever be a point where they become equivalent to real life?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That moment has finally come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore’s Law, a computing term which originated around 1970, states that the processing power of computers doubles every two years. This directly leads to computer graphics increasing significantly over the years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does all of this matter in the game development industry? &nbsp;The best way to increase the graphical fidelity of a game is to add realistic lighting:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left with no lightning, right with a single light source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9628\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"974\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2.png 974w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2-300x85.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2-768x217.png 768w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture2-213x60.png 213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\"></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left with no lightning, right with a single light source.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while adding lights in a game is relatively easy, and something we’ve been doing for decades, getting the light to bounce off, reflect, refract, and move around realistically is a much more difficult problem to solve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forefront of photorealistic graphics today is seen in the computer-generated imagery used in movies. If you’ve seen &nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War, you could reasonably argue that CGI&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is pretty much photorealistic already, and that’s because big-budget movies use a lighting technique called&nbsp;</span><b>ray tracing&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for their CGI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray tracing calculates the path of a beam of light backwards from your eye (or viewpoint) to the objects that the light interacted with. It’s what makes reflections, shadows, and refractions look extremely realistic. But here’s the catch,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray tracing is so computationally intensive that it takes days, or even weeks, to render these worlds even with many computers working together in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">render farms.”</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So you may ask the question, with the immense increase in computational power, why I do not have ray tracing? The answer sadly is, you can have it, but for 1.4 lakhs.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-9635\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5.png 443w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5-300x200.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture5-90x60.png 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\"></a><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-9634\" src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/http://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"159\" srcset=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4.png 443w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4-300x198.png 300w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031409im_/https://www.lnexun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture4-91x60.png 91w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the launch of the RTX graphics cards, NVIDIA is bridging the gap between pre rendered and real time graphics.
